Drink water to prevent dehydration.\n\nDo the 5x5 breathing:\n5 seconds inhale\n5 seconds hold at the top\n5 seconds exhale\n5 seconds hold at the bottom\n\n5 times\n\nDo this at the beginning and at the end of the day, and when you are feeling stressed.\n\nTake the measurements before the course starts!\n\nPractice conscious movement, how many steps do you take every day? Try to move more every day, walk more, but for now, just measure how much you move every day.\n\nWhen you do the things that you know that should do and you don't do the things that you know you should not do. The stronger your self-esteem gets and the easier it becomes for you.\n\nIf you binged on certain things before starting the course that means you have emotional attachments to certain foods, and with this when you take it away, the craving goes up and the attachment goes up.\n\nIf you started eating more healthy before the course started, that means you have willpower, but how long will this willpower last? This typically lasts for 7 or 8 days.\n\nWhat are you most afraid that Wildfit will take from you?\n\nYou don't have to give up nothing at all. This week eat the same as you have before!\n\nTo make the program as effective for you:\n- Watch the videos as they come out.\n- Trust the process\n\nThis week, follow your natural inclinations and cravings.\n\nThe success tableau:\nMoment in time in the future, that has such an emotional pull that will make you push through every challenge. A moment in your future that really charges you up emotionally. Imagine the transformation in the future. You can draw from this when the challenge gets difficult.\n\nRock bottom perspective:\nWhat pushes you, a moment in your future that's shocking, something that's painful, something that will happen if you don't follow through with the program. Like looking at a doctor's office and seeing something bad there, and wishing you had taken action earlier. Rock bottom is one of the most powerful places of transformation. It's a very scary face.\n\nPeople in rock bottom they change or they die. You can project your consciousness in the future and see ahead and know that you don't want that.\n\nDO THE BONUS ON WEEK 0.\n\nIf you want to be amazing in everything, the first step is to be healthy\n\nRecord a message.\n\nDear me, this is why I'm here, this is the discomfort, the change I want to make, I find it painful, and I'm concerned about the future. So I made the decision to change.\n\nThe word Diet means \"a way of life\". Our job is not to go on a temporary change for a special event, our job is to be back on our diet.\n\nLanguage matters, you don't lose weight, you RELEASE it. You don't need this weight anymore.\n\nCalories in, calories out is BS.\n\n## Day 2\nDiets don't work, they are based on restriction and on willpower.\n\n\"I want to enjoy life\", but if you want something that damages you, if you could feel the adverse effects that some foods have on you, you would not want to have those foods.\n\nYou have foods that fulfill certain emotions.\n\nProgress drives motivation. Celebration is key for the creation of habits.\n\nThe ingredient for lasting change is emotional engagement, emotional intensity.\n\nCelebration makes you repeat the activity you did leading up to it.

understanding, helping people recognize their true needs without extreme restriction.\n\n## Day 4\nEmotional hunger: The more manipulative\n\nBefore you take a food, first you think about the decision to eat that food, before the decision, you deal with the emotional state that you are in\n\n### Food timeline\nEmotional state -> Decision -> Acquiring the food -> Consuming the food -> The smell -> The first bite -> The second bite -> Continuation -> Feeling after eating it -> Feeling 30 minutes later -> Feeling before going to bed -> Feeling the next morning\n\nIn order to pay attention to this, you need to amplify your consciousness.\n\nHumans are good with identifying short term consequences, long term not so much.\n\nThe idea is to increase your consciousness about the consequences.\n\nWhen you eat junk food, when do you start to feel better? You don't feel better when you eat it, you feel better with the realization. It's the internal permission and rebellion that makes you feel better, the brain secretes feel good chemicals, and then they get linked with the eating of the ice cream. and the ice cream tastes even better because of the feel good chemicals, and it reinforces the idea that the ice cream was the cure. It wasn't.\n\nHow do you feel after consuming the ice cream, the sugar? 30 minutes later, at night, in the morning?\n\nWhat emotional state were you in when deciding to consume a food, how do you feel once you made the decision to have a food, how do you feel when you buy it, then right before you eat it, then the first bite, then the second, third bite, finishing it? Then how did you feel when you were done? 30 minutes later, that night, the next morning?\n\nPay attention to your food timeline.\n\nhttps://challenge.getwildfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Food-Timeline-Worksheet_v1_compressed.pdf\n\nWe want to connect the consciousness of the long term consequences to the eating now.\n\nStick to your current eating habits.\n\n## Day 5\nYou have never failed a diet, because the instructions were wrong. And each time that you failed your self-esteem took a hit.\n\nBoredom is a form of safety. Boredom is a sign from your body that you are safe to eat.\n\nDon't reward bad behavior. When life gets hard you need the best nutrition, the best hydration.\n\nBad emotions are there for you to become a better human being\n\n### Recognizing patterns\nReward re-patterning: Your brain produces feel good chemicals that reward you for doing things that are \"good for you\". Emotional responses are both a reward and a memory trigger.\n\nIn the past, this was very helpful but now we are rewarded for doing disastrous things. Our reward system has been hijacked.\n\nIf you do something that gives your body all this serotonin and this dopamine, your body asks \"how do I do this again\", so, any emotion or behavior that you want to stay, reward it, so it is more likely to be repeated.\n\nIf when things get though, you have a bad day, you reward yourself with calories, with sugar, the body remembers, and thinks that in order to keep that, you have to find sadness, frustration and depression.\n\nIf you use food to distract you from emotional pain, your body will remember that in order to get that calorie payoff it needs to trigger that pain, and then you'll be trapped in a cycle. Instead, bring consciousness to the table.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6874, "end_char_idx": 11230, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163a629c-ce43-4328-ac56-f6956910bdc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "163a629c-ce43-4328-ac56-f6956910bdc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 1.md", "file_name": "Week 1.md", "file_size": 12900, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed0bee56-7fa4-4642-8bc0-8abd4430d4ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 1.md", "file_name": "Week 1.md", "file_size": 12900, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "6166853695047bd24abd39f8d37bc53f2aab41b05f9faf1e51c70524f3cc7a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d0d5fb9-f7ed-4281-b731-ba1c7de130ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 1.md", "file_name": "Week 1.md", "file_size": 12900, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "df4651044976823de090b3f3bcf0090f91f525b3d7b984e7a0562e7253551243", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Emotional responses are both a reward and a memory trigger.\n\nIn the past, this was very helpful but now we are rewarded for doing disastrous things.

Your health is far more influenced by getting more of the good stuff rather than eliminating the bad things. Your body has an immense capacity for healing.\n\nEnhancements:\nThey are optional through the weekend but officially implemented on Monday.\n\nIncrease significantly fruit intake. The best way to eat fruit is on an empty stomach. Fruit is a transportation mechanism for seeds. The plant wants to be eaten. If you have a sweet tooth, this will be very helpful for you.\n\nIncrease your vegetable intake. In terms of quantity, quality and variety. Experience with organic, and with vegetables you have never taken before.\n\nIncorporate the alkagizer mild. The smoothie recipe, but take note, chewing is always better than blending. No one vegetable should be eaten every single day of the year. The base recipe is a template, you can change the vegetables there. The objective is to get vegetables.\n\nFocus on high quality proteins. meat, fish, eggs, poultry. Focus on quality.

Fasting is one of the most important aspects of human life.\n\nYou body has the ability to burn 3 different types of fuel. Sugar, fat and protein.\n\nIf you put carbohydrates, it will burn that. as long as you are consuming carbohydrates your body will not burn fat. In spring we remove carbohydrates and it burns fat.\n\nIf you don't have any food at all, it will burn protein. It will not burn high quality proteins, it will start with broken, low quality, clogging proteins first. The winter fast is a very important cleansing property.\n\nFasting mistakes:\n1. Get into a fruit fast before the actual fasting. This makes you crave sugar more.\n2. Long term fasting (7 days is too much!)\n3. Don't do any physical activity, putting your body in a sort of physical hibernation. You need to move!\n4. Break your fast with coconut water and fresh fruit. Immediately causes huge sugar cravings.\n\nFasting can be very important for your preventative health protocols.\n\nThis friday, we will move out of spring, and then back into spring.\n\n## FAQ\nHow long should I stay in winter?\nDepends with your experience and response, take it one day at a time. After 48 hours is when the magic starts to happen, here your body moves into protein burning.\n\nBreak your fast in the mid morning of the fourth day.\n\nYou can go on longer, but it is easier when you are in a fasting environment, it is not recommended to do it if you will be making important decisions, driving, operating heavy machinery.\n\n02 - WHAT IF I CAN\u2019T COMPLETE THE FULL 3 DAY FAST?\nIt is fine, no problem. Don't suffer, it's about metabolic reset.\n\n03 - I CHOSE NOT TO DO THE FAST AND I\u2019M STAYING IN SPRING. IS THAT OK?\nYes! it is optional\n\n04 - WHY DO I FEEL SO EMOTIONAL WHEN FASTING?\nWhen you do this, you are changing things inside your body, and that change might reflect on your body. By the third day this goes away, and if you do this more and more it is easier. Ease your way in and develop comfort with it.\n\n05 - I CHOSE TO STAY IN SPRING. AM I MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING BY NOT DOING THE WINTER FAST?\nNot really, spring is wonderful, winter fast has a different purpose. Burning protein is very important for your body, is an anti-cancer protocol. Do it in sometime in the future.\n\n06 - SHOULD I CHANGE HOW I EXERCISE THIS WEEK?\nMaybe, in spring, no, if in winter. If this is your first time you will have energy fluctuation, don't go into lazyness mode, don't rest all day. Our ancestors, when there was no food, you went out to find it, also, when you stop moving, your body stops generating energy, seeking energy from your own body.\n\nMaintain some level of movement so you are making energy demands on your body. If you are experienced, you can do everything regularly, if you are just starting, do it lightly.\n\n07 - HOW DO I KNOW THAT MY METABOLISM IS REALLY DOING THE RESET THAT IT\u2019S MEANT TO DO?\nOften people notice that their tastebuds change, and a change in energy, cravings, sleep, and moods.\n\nInto fast, initially it can be a little bit of havok.\n\n08 - WHAT\u2019S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME TO BE FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW?\nFeelings of restriction, lack of variety, the further away you get from the pain and discomfort, the less it motivates you.\nWhen we are in pain, we are more motivated to act. When you make progress, the food devil might come and say you \"deserve\" food.\n\nMaintain your perspective, the previous pain, and the progress thus far.\n\n## Day 5\nWe have been in spring. You took action and have done an incredible job. We will come out of spring. Some people say \"thank god\", another reaction is \"I feel so good.\"\n\nThis is an important principle:\n\n**Never ever leave spring without knowing when you will go back in.**\n\nKnow this for the rest of your life.\n\nWhen you are in a carbohydrate season, you crave more carbohydrates. When you are in spring, you drop those cravings.\n\nWhen you come out of spring, you will naturally want more carbs, and the more you are out of spring the more cravings you will have.

So the more carbs you eat, the more cravings you generate and the more food awareness you generate.\n\nThis is why the food industry wants you in carb mode, to get you. For you to notice food more. Carbs take away your freedom, this is what they do. This is a survival mechanism, to eat more, see all the food opportunities and survive the winter.\n\nPay attention and feel your freedom fade away. But remember, never leave spring without knowing when are you going back into it. You want the experience of moving back and forth into seasons. Maintain your observations.\n\nYou may not want to move back into spring, but soon you will feel the benefits and remember why you did it.\n\n### RECONNECT WITH YOUR WHY.\n\nThis worksheet is designed to help you reflect on where you started, celebrate your progress, and reconnect with the deep reasons you began this journey.\n\nOn a separate piece of paper, journal using the following prompts:\n\nYour Original WHY: What motivated you to join the WILDERBODY Experience? Write about the emotional, physical, or life circumstances that pushed you to say \"yes\" to this journey.\n\nYour Starting Point Reflect back to Week 1 (or the Food Freedom Challenge). Describe:\n- Your physical state (energy, pain, digestion, sleep, weight):\n- Your mental/emotional state (cravings, self-talk, confidence, stress):\n- Any unhealthy habits you wanted to break\n\nWhere You Are Now. How have things shifted?\n- What has improved physically?\n- What's improved emotionally or mentally?\n- What cravings, patterns, or beliefs no longer control you?\n\nUnexpected Wins\nWhat changes or realizations surprised you most along the way?\n\nLooking Ahead\n- What do you want to continue working on?\n- What is your updated WHY as you move forward?\n## FAQ\n\n01 - HOW DO I KNOW IF I\u2019M READY TO TRANSITION OUT OF SPRING?\nIf you are not super comfortable coming in and out, do it, and then we will go back into spring. This is to develop your own wildfit independence.\n\n02 - HOW SHOULD I START REINTRODUCING CARBOHYDRATE FOODS?\nDo not go with processed, garbage carbohydrates, no refined sugar.\n\nStart slowly with root vegetables, berries, lower in sugar.\n\nPay attention to how your body reacts, they are going to be amazing, and notice how the cravings start to come up, notice how the carbs start to take your freedom away. Carbs are designed to help you fatten up for the winter.\n\n03 - WHAT IF I FEEL BAD AFTER REINTRODUCING SOME FOODS?\nThat would be incredible, pay attention to the food timeline. This will help you to carve out a real sense of freedom. Many people when the come out of spring and eat something, that's when they carve out their freedom.\n\nIf you had an adverse reaction to something you ate, take it as learning, it is important to record and learn from.\n\n04 - HOW SHOULD I MOVE WITH THESE INTRODUCTIONS? SHOULD I EAT A LOT, SHOULD I EAT SLOWLY?\nStart slowly with small quantities, and simply. just one ingredient, do this very slowly so you don't get an explosion of cravings, and you see what is going on. Also, the more complicated your meal is, the more harder it goes to your digestive system.\n\nAlso, if you complicate the meal, and you have an adverse reaction, you won't know what caused it, otherwise, you will have a much better learning opportunity.\n\n05 - SHOULD I RE-INTRODUCE, OR CONTINUE HAVING MY ALKAGIZERS?\nContinue having them, don't renitroduce the alkagizer mild. Do the one that's pure vegetables. It is also okay to not have alkagizer, it is better for you to eat your vegetables instead of blending them.\n\nImportant: Our ancestors never had consistent access to the same fruits and vegetables every day. They had a cyclical relationship with them, there is no perfect alkagizer, fruit or vegetable for every single day.\n\nThey are meant to be cicles, eat plants long enough to get the good. Not enough for the bad to accumulate. Every single plant has benefits and consequences, so be careful about that\n\n06 - HOW SHOULD I HANDLE EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS AS I START ADDING CARBOHYDRATE FOODS BACK IN?\nCarefully.

The sugar monster is coming back in.\n\nAny behavior or emotion that you reward is likely to be repeated, it is incredible important, because your body receives all carbohydrate foods as a reward, if you had a really bad day, that's not the day you want to have a handful of berries, don't reward a bad mood or an unproductive day with this big calorie explosion.\n\nIf you are having some adverse moods, and you reward your body with carbs, you are teaching your body that the path to those carbs is to have a bad emotional day. Carbs are best had in a celebratory fashion. Productivity, exercise, good news.\n\n07 - HOW DO I STAY MOTIVATED IF MY RESULTS ARE SLOWING DOWN?\nIt can happen this week. Look at the larger picture. You are making incredible psychological progress, the focus of the program is lasting freedom, lasting results and lasting transformation, and food independence.\n\nWatch your emotions and your internal dialogue this week.\n\n08 - WHAT IF I WANT TO STAY IN SPRING FOR LONGER?\nYou can, do it supported. If you are not comfortable coming in and out of spring come out and we will go back in next week.\n\n09 - THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABOUT METABOLIC RESET. AM I GOING TO RESET MY METABOLISM BADLY BY COMING OUT OF SPRING?\nThe idea is not to teach you, is to develop metabolic flexibility, so that your body adapts to autumn, spring, winter.\n\nWhen people never had done keto or fasting before, the first time is very hard, the more times you do this, the more flexible your body becomes. Same thing with the fast.\n\nAnd every time you make that switch, it becomes easier and better. Keep at it! Future times are easier, this is metabolic flexibility for your food freedom.\n\n10 - CAN I EVER EAT OFF-PLAN FOODS AGAIN WITHOUT GUILT?\nA telling question, never a food is \"Wildfit approved\", it can be recommended, ideal, not ideal.\n\nThe idea is that you create your own rules about what you eat and what you don't. The program is about freedom, there are no rules, but there are recommendations.\n\nCan I ever have not recommended food again? Yes! This program is about freedom.\n\nNote:\nSome of the freedom that you will obtain in life will come after you experiment with something.\n\nLater, we will talk about how to make experiments. So you eat it and pay attention to how you feel. And what may happen is that the illusion of the food may pop when you actually eat it, and then you will be free of that food.\n\nThis is about your freedom and your liberty.\n\nExperiments are about:\n- Increased consciousness\n- Notice how we made the decision.\n- Make a commitment to really pay attention to the process.\n- Make a commitment that no matter how good it is, we are not having any more of it. So that it doesn't end up on a cascade.\n\nMuch of your freedom will come from these types of experiments.\n\n\n## Day 5\nCelebrating your spring progress.\n\nCarbs can play a big role in your life, and take away your freedom.\n\nThis friday, we will go back again into spring. you will say goodbye to carbs for another week.\n\nThis time it will be easier for you to go back into spring.\n\nThe purpose of this is to create benefit for you in the future.\n\nYou might want to book a back to spring session 2 months from now.

This is a season you want to be comfortable with.\n\nThe reason we did it this way this week, is the experience of guiding you in and out of spring.\n\nCarbohydrates serve the function of preparing your body for winter and to fatten up to survive it.\n\nThe idea is for you to easily switch back and forth between seasons.\n\nIn earlier versions of the program, people struggled to get out of spring after it we over.\n\n02 - HOW STRICT DO I NEED TO BE IN THIS RETURN TO SPRING?\nYour sugar monster asked that question! You need to be in spring, no carbohydrates. We are talking about no obvious carbohydrates, you want to develop metabolic flexibility. If you are having carbs every day then the change wont happen with you.\n\n03 - WHAT IF I DON\u2019T FEEL LIKE I NEED ANOTHER SPRING RESET?\nYour food devil is asking this question, spring is a requirement of the human body, that's the end of it. Your ancestors never had a choice about this. It was done to them.\n\nYour body has the ability to burn sugar, fat and old, sick and broken proteins. It's not that you enjoy them or they are \"nice\", is that you have to do them.\n\nThis is not about weight loss, this is about metabolic flexibility. Specially if you don't feel like it, this is the week to do spring.\n\n04 - HOW DO I MAINTAIN THIS PROGRESS AFTER THE PROGRAM ENDS?\nRemember how life was for you before the program. You may have doubt about the future. This program is designed to permanently change your relationship with food.\n\nYou will never experience food the same way before. How do you maintain the program after it ends?\n\nWe have rewritten you psychology regarding food, also in week 13 we will recap all the tools and give you some more for your future.\n\nThere is also a community, maintain your bonds. If you have a coach, you can get the Wildfit continuity membership, the back to spring program.\n\nAnd some people do the program again on their own.\n\nYou are able to hold on to the progress you have made, and continue to keep making progress.\n\n05 - SHOULD I STAY MOSTLY IN SPRING MODE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?\nHumans evolved to cycle through this metabolic modes, we have to run these cicles and not get stuck in any more.

What do you do when that happens?\n\nMake a decision to run an experiment, yes or no, and don't allow it become a trigger to \"slip back\" into old habits. Notice how it makes you feel, and make a commitment to yourself that your experiment is limited to this instance, or this day, or these two days.\n\nThis will prevent it becoming a cascading effect.\n\nThis is not about living constrained and restricted, it's about your freedom, and freedom means the right to experiment with stuff, but it also means maintaining your freedom from those foods and the disastrous food industry, when they are trying to win you back all the time.\n\n07 - WILL MY CRAVINGS COME BACK WHEN THIS PROGRAM ENDS?\nDid you notice your cravings becoming stronger when you reintroduced carbs?\nIts more about A) Your commitment to your health, B) Your relationship with carbohydrates.\n\nCarbohydrates are designed to take away your freedom, they are made to make you eat, and to fatten up for the winter. If you reintroduce them without being clear when you will return back to spring, yes, your old cravings will come raging back. You will repopulate your gut bacteria with bacteria that wants carbs. And then, it will be harder for you to go back to spring.\n\nSo the best way you know that doesn't happen, is that you never leave spring without knowing when you are coming back.\n\n08 - HOW SHOULD I HANDLE SPECIAL OCCASIONS, REUNIONS, VACATIONS AND CELEBRATIONS IN THE FUTURE?\nMany people will tell you \"I was doing really well, then X happened\", what is that? A holiday, christmas, I lost my job, something bad happened.\n\nFirst let's talk about the good occasions.\nYou have to be aware of the deep seated manipulations of the food industry.\n\nYou can take it in two ways, the first one is simply not having the non-functional food. The other is running the experiment carefully and with two things in mind:\n1. Having the very best quality of the food\n2. Do it inside the parenthesis of an experiment. And stick to the end date no matter what.\n\nWillpower is for stopping the pattern. Do this, and two days later the cravings pass.\n\nFor the bad occasions:\nFor some reason, when life gets difficult, we go back to easy calories, carbs and alcohol, this is because the body is stressed and it prioritizes sugar as a fuel source.\n\nWhat does your body really need when you are in that kind of stress? It needs the very best nutrition. The best season is spring, the best season for those times is hunter spring. And even with some punctuations of winter during those times.\n\nIn spring, your moods and emotions are better, during though times, spring is the way to go.\n\n## Day 5\nEmbracing the power of choice.\n\nWe will have another 2 more weeks! Next week you chose what season you want. Fall, Spring.

This psychology is a huge part of your freedom.\n\nRemember the 6 hungers.\n\nThirst: Drinking water before eating\n\nNutritional hunger: Eating enough high quality foods.\n\nLow blood sugar: (spring eliminates this)\n\nEmotional hunger: Using food as a drug, to make you feel better.\n\nVariety: We can experiment, learn different ways to cook, create variety within the context of healthy food, or new experiences.\n\nEmpty stomach: You can be incredibly well nourished and your stomach can be empty.\n\nMade the decision to maintain a conscious relationship with these hungers.\n\n### Two principles:\nCelebration is the locking-in of behavior. What is your celebration of finishing wildfit. focus on what went well.\n\nSomething motivated you to be here, pain, discomfort, maybe they are gone or greatly reduced, you should celebrate that! Remember that the further away the pain is, the less motivating it is. Even the pain can become part of the motivation.\n\n## Mastering Food Freedom\nSeasons - Ancestral food rythms\nThe core principle is this:\nANIMALS OR ORGANISMS EVOLVE ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY LIVE\n\nIf we flow with the seasons, we will have optimal health, if we get stuck in one season, we will start to develop issues. Which seasons? We are talking about the seasons from Sub-Saharan Africa, where our ancestors developed.\n\nSummer: Plant life is everywhere, tons of food, berries, early honey\nAutumn: Lot more carbs available, honey, root vegetables, easy to find food\nWinter: Cold, dry, drought, food is scarce, the #1 cause of death is starvation, here the body burns protein, old skin cells, \"cleaning house\", it looks to burn the broken stuff\nSpring: Rain comes, all the wild animals give birth at the same times, this creates an incredible hunting season.\n\nWhat is each season for?\nSummer: The reintroduction of carbohydrates to start preparing for winter\nAutumn: A season of accumulation (fat, water), and slowing your metabolism, to retain energy and survive the winter.\nWinter: A season of lack, repair and cleansing. What might happen if someone does not do this cleansing, would they be clogged up? Develop cancer? By Eric's opinion, this is the single most effective cancer prevention protocol.\nSpring: A season of rebuilding and abundance, greens and meat in abundance, rebuild muscle mass, bone density.\n\nThere are really only 3:\nWinter: Cleansing season\nSpring: Recovery and rebuilding season\nSummer/Fall: Accumulation, preparation\n\nWe have 3 modes for those metabolic seasons.\nWinter: Burning protein, removing old cell\nSpring: Burning fat (ketosis)\nSummer/fall: Burn sugar\n\nIf you skip one of these seasons, you might have consequences, and you skip the benefit of this mode, which will manifest later in life. It's very very difficult to skip fall.\n\nYou want to create ancestral food rhythms:\n1. Seasons, choosing seasons consciously.\n2. Fasting, delaying your first meal is an ancestral rhythm, wake up in the morning, go to the gym, have a walk, and then have breakfast. Equally, at night, don't eat at night, as a hunter gatherer you did not eat at night.\n3. Pace of eating, chew enough, and not hurt your body's own satiation signals. Slow down your consumption of food, chew properly, and chew your fruits and vegetables\n\nHow many days would you like to stay in spring, summer or winter.\n\nEric's ratio is:\n3 weeks of spring\n3 -4 days of autumn\n3 day winter fast\n\nThis is optimized for him, building muscle.\n\nIf you have certain symptomology, then you want spring to be the bigger part of your ratio, if you want to do cleansing, then you want to add winter. Mostly you don't have to force yourself to be in fall.\n\nWhen you leave spring, you must know when to go back.\n\nImportant:\nWhat seasonal ratios do you want to operate with?\nHow do you want to start and finish your days?\nThe pace at which you eat. With any foods that produce hunger, you really hae to be mindful of eating slowly and chewing.

With any foods that produce hunger, you really hae to be mindful of eating slowly and chewing. Fruit, nuts, and of course, junk food.\n\n## Strengthening your resilience\nParenthetical food experiences\n\nExperiences that are inside parenthesis, a dysfunctional food habit becomes the norm and the functional food situation takes place sparingly, we are going to switch it. The parenthesis is the occasional treats you will give yourself.\n\nWhen you treat yourself, treat yourself well. Uplevel the quality of your parenthetical experiences. Have responsible food, not full of chemicals and refined sugar. Not pretending that that is an elixir of health, but it's not so bad for you.\n\nFood Experiments: With foods that are not totally out of the food escape velocity, it's okay, a food experiment is a temporal food experience, designed to allow you to experiment the given enjoyment and consequences to a certain food. When you make an experiment, define a end date to close the experiment. Conduct short experiments\n\nDuring travel, you can expand the parenthesis, but no more than 7 days, never more than 7 days, if it runs for more than 7 days, you run into the risk of your gut bacteria changing, your psychology, your identity, and then you are back to the start.\n\nEat the best quality food, and create a temporary time period, and the key is that you do it with intense consciousness. If you are not observing, it's not an experiment. You may notice you feel okay, or feel bad after, be very conscious of how you feel.\n\nPrinciples:\n- Uplevel the quality\n- Food Experiments\n- Do it with intense consciousness\n- It's better not to conduct lots of experiments, specially when you are in a health recovery journey.\n- Don't eat junk food when you are suffering.\n\nWhen you are recovering, and you experiment, it's kind of a setback.\n\nDon't do parenthetical food experiences when you are suffering, grieving, with anxiety, stress, because you need your best mind, and body for these experiences. Any behavior that you reward, gets repeated.\n\n## Identity over willpower\nFood dialogue, angel and devil dialogue. A strategy known is a strategy blown.\n\nIf there is a particular food devil you struggle with, you can print a face of it on the house, on the kitchen, to make it more conscious.\n\nFood timeline, unconscious eating is a survival mechanism. This is the application of consciousness to the whole food eating process. When you are eating conscious food then this does not matter too much. But if you run an experiment, you'll notice the consequences.\n\nAlso, if you feel a problem, don't try to solve it with food, because they distract you, instead feel the emotion and analyze what is happening. Do things that actually solves the problem.\n\nReward-repatterining, any behavior or emotional state that your reward is very likely to be repeated. NEVER reward negative emotions with high calorie food. Use them for rewards for unbelivable functional behavior. \"reward\" your very best behaviors, you will lock in those behaviors, and then you won't feel the need to go for the food.\n\nEmotional eating leads always to disaster, instead change your state with things other than food, and you never reward bad behaviors, only great results and behaviors, with high quality foods.\n\n## Are you still free?\nThis challenge is over, but it is the beginning of a new way of life. \n\nCourse correction. Life is going to interfere. If you find yourself sliding back to not wanting to go back to spring, or winter.\n\nThere's a technique, \"The countdown technique\", you realize that you have slid a little, with a season or dysfunctional food.

When this happens, the minute you realize you have gone off course, the number pops on your head (less than 10), that's your body telling you how long you have to fix it. This means, X days from now on, we are getting back into spring, no matter if we do it alone or with a coach or with other people. And the time between today and X is the buffer zone. And when the buffer zone ends, you start spring, and you lift the food quality. Be it spring, or re-enroll in wildfit.\n\nAgree to follow this, and your subconscious mind will tell you a number, it will.\n\nThere is freedom on the other side of a promise. Your only value in the world is your integrity, you can lose everything but if you are a man of your word, you'll rebuild everything.\n\nFrom now on, treat promise differently, promise will mean \"no matter what, this is how it's going to be done, period, it's solid, it's done\". So the day you make the decision that your promises mean something, you will not break your promise to yourself or others. Don't make promises you can't keep.\n\nStart with small promises, and every time you keep your promises your self esteem build. When you do what you say you will do, your self-esteem grows. Promises you make to yourself, never break them.\n\nBe very mindful with your promises, only make promises you are fully committed to keeping.\n\nWhat if you said \"I promise I will be in spring for two weeks\". When you are first building this way of seeing at promises, don't make promises too big, because you will break them and lower your self-esteem, or keep them and be so frightened about making promises in the future.\n\nUpgrade your promise, to yourself, to other people. Start small, and then use it to control going in and out of seasons, to make food experiments.\n\nThe food industry will never give up, so make yourself clear to you on why you are here and why you want to live a better life.\n\nYour two futures:\n1. The future the food industry wants for you: Eat their products. Remember the rock bottom tableau.\n2. The great health you can get: If you are emotionally connected to your highest vision, you will be drawn towards it.\n\nRemember the vision you have for your health, your mobility, the doctors' appointments, your end of life process.\n\nWhen other people tempt you into their way of living and eating again, know that by not doing it, you are actually helping them. Your health will be around the average of the 6 people you spend the most time with.\n\nCreate a network of health-oriented people.\n\nYou can even get into the living wildfit membership. Give thanks to your coach.\n\n## FAQ\n### WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS, AM I ON MY OWN?\nThere is a problem of confidence created by the diet industry, the good news is that you didn't go on a diet. You are not on your own, because this is not over. There is a larger WildFit community. Go somewhere far with people, go together as a team. Even you can become the leader in your own community, be the change you want to see in your community.\n\nYou can even get a coach if you need so, and retake the program, and the back to spring program.\n\n### WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON\u2019T GET ALL THE RESULTS I WAS LOOKING FOR?\nEverybody comes to this program with a different set of goals. Generally speaking, people have spent a decade in the wrong direction, and we have just spent 3 months together. Now you have had some incredible benefit.\n\nConsider that the problems you have had may need more time, as you stay on track you will keep continuing on your goals.\n\nAlso, focus on what went well, you will be more motivated, and keep on track.

Focus on the things you have done well, and be proud of that! On what you have improved\n\n### \u00a0HOW DO I KEEP GOING WITHOUT THE DAILY VIDEOS?\n\u00a0You can keep on by listening to your own internal dialogue and seeing how you react to the daily \"temptations\" every time you reject the negative voices, they become quieter, every time you empower the positive voices, you make them louder.\nYou still have the content, and there is a wildfit membership program.\n\n### WHEN SHOULD I GO INTO SPRING NEXT?\nYou decide! We never leave spring unless we know when we will go back into spring again. So decide when you will get into your next spring or winter fast.\n\n### NOW THAT THE PROGRAM\u2019S DONE, CAN I EAT ANYTHING I WANT?\nStrictly speaking, you can. The program is all about freedom. But, do you really want to eat back the way you eat? Are there any foods you will never had?\n\nPay attention to the process about food experimentation. Be conscious about the choices you make, the experiments and the food you eat. Some of the best food freedom you will get is when you conduct an experiment.\n\n### WHAT IF I FALL OFF THE WAGON OR SLIP UP AFTER A FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS?\nWildfit does not have a wagon, there is no wagon to fall off. But there is a chance you forget the principles, that's why we do this refresher in week 13, and why we create your food constitution.\n\nUsually people are kicked off from the wagon by the food industry. And we will show you how to let it happen in a controlled manner, and then course correct. The more often you will course correct, the better off will be.\n\nKnow you will need to make course corrections, and the faster you make them, the better.\n\n### HOW DO I MAINTAIN MY MOTIVATION NOW THAT THE STRUCTURE IS ENDING?\nYou are responsible to maintain your motivation, what is it that you want and not want? Success tableau and rock bottom perspective, if you maintain focus on these both perspectives you will maintain motivation. Also, progress, you have to know what your progress has been, positive steps. Remember that something drove you to spend time here. If you are not in pain, it easier to listen to the food devil.\n\n### WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN THE SOCIAL PRESSURE COMES BACK?\n- **Social Pressure is Real:** Be prepared for friends and family (the \"food industry's agents\") to tempt you back into old eating habits with loving gestures, special occasions, and justifications (like holidays).\n- **Find Your Balance:** Don't aim for rigid perfection, but prioritize your health. Remember the risks of poor health: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, inflammation, and chronic medication.\n- **Define Your Rules:** Clearly define your food constitution, rules, flexibility, experimentation, and course correction strategies.\n- **Social Responsibility:** Recognize the broader impact of your health choices. A healthier population is more resilient to pandemics, reduces strain on healthcare systems, and discourages the food industry from producing unhealthy foods.\n- **Lead by Example:** Focus on changing yourself first. Your friends' attempts to sway you might stem from their own insecurities about their health choices.

Your friends' attempts to sway you might stem from their own insecurities about their health choices. Your strength can make them feel weak, so be the change you want to see in them.\n- **Occasional Treats are Okay:** It's fine to indulge occasionally, but consider the context. If you're with healthy people, it's less of an issue. If you're with people struggling with their health, holding the line can be a positive influence.\n## WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I SHOULD CARRY FORWARD FROM THIS PROGRAM?\nThe most important takeaway from the program is that **your health span is your responsibility.** No one will care about your health as much as you do. Health span (living as long as you enjoyably can in the best possible state) is more important than longevity (merely living a long time, potentially reliant on medical interventions).\n\n### WHAT IF I STILL HAVE SOME LINGERING CRAVINGS?\n- T**wo Types of Cravings:** Recognize the difference between natural cravings (triggered by natural hungers) and manipulated cravings (driven by the food industry). You've already addressed many of the manipulated cravings during the program.\n- **Triggers:** Be aware of potential triggers that can reactivate cravings:\n    - **Deep Emotional Experiences:** Job problems, loss of life, relationship breakups. During these times, prioritize nourishing and hydrating yourself well instead of turning to junk food.\n    - **Familiarity:** Driving through old neighborhoods, attending events, being around old friends, seeing advertisements, or experiencing life events.\n    - **Reintroducing Carbs (Coming out of Spring):** Expect increased cravings when you reintroduce carbohydrates. Understand this is a natural, evolutionary response, not a personal failing.\n- **Strengthening vs. Weakening Cravings:** Every time you give in to a craving, you strengthen it. Every time you resist a craving, you weaken it.\n- **Consciousness is Key:** When cravings arise, especially after reintroducing carbs, recognize them as an old, outdated evolutionary message. Bring your consciousness to bear and understand that times have changed.\n- **Use Your Tools:** Pay attention to the tools and resources you learned during the program, such as the food timeline and food dialogue.\n- **Remember the Impact:** A craving you respond to will come back stronger. A craving you resist will come back weaker.\n\n### WHAT IF I DON\u2019T WANT TO EVER GO BACK IN SPRING AGAIN, BUT I STILL WANT THE BENEFITS OF A RESET?\n- **Freedom of Choice:** You have the freedom to live as you choose.\n- **Seasonal Benefits:** Each season plays an important role in your metabolism. Humans weren't meant to live in only one season. Experiencing all seasons is optimal.\n- **Springtime PTSD:** If you're hesitant to return to Spring due to past difficulties, understand that it gets easier each time.\n- **Metabolic Flexibility:** With each Spring and Winter fast, your body becomes more metabolically flexible.\n- **Support is Available:** Consider working with a WildFit coach and doing the \"Back to Spring\" program for support. It's a shorter, more concise program.\n- **Evolutionary Design:** Humans evolved to experience each metabolic mode, and these modes have functions that need to take place for optimal health.\n- **Keep an Open Mind:** Revisit Spring from time to time, even if it's not for as long or with support.\n\n### \u00a0I\u2019M NERVOUS ABOUT EATING OUT AGAIN. WHAT IF IT UNRAVELS ME?\n- **Restaurants as Resellers:** Recognize that most restaurants are resellers for the food industry, focused on making food yummy and convenient while boosting profits.\n- **Categorize Restaurants:**\n    - **Never Again:** Identify restaurants that you realize aren't selling real food and avoid them.\n    - **Navigable:** Restaurants where you can make conscious choices.\n    - **Incredible:** Restaurants with well-sourced, well-prepared food. Prioritize these when possible.\n- **Menu as Ingredients List:** Remember that a menu is just a poorly organized list of available ingredients. You can often create healthier combinations by ordering items separately (e.g., grilled salmon with broccoli instead of salmon cream linguini).\n- **\"That Person\":** Don't be afraid to be \"that person\" who modifies their order. The benefits of avoiding heart disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic medications, and living a fulfilling, healthy life outweigh the social awkwardness.

The benefits of avoiding heart disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic medications, and living a fulfilling, healthy life outweigh the social awkwardness. Be that person!\n\n### WHAT DO I DO IF MY FAMILY STILL EATS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ME?\n- **Acknowledge the Difficulty:** It's difficult to watch family members trapped by the food industry and see the potential consequences. It can feel similar to having a family member with alcoholism.\n- **Resist the Urge to Push:** Do not try to push your family to change, as they will resist.\n- **Lead by Example:** Be the change you want to see in your family. Show them what's possible.\n- **Attract, Don't Persuade:** Attract them to your way of eating rather than trying to persuade them.\n- **Permission to Persuade:** When they become curious and ask questions, you have permission to persuade. Persuading without permission creates resistance.\n- **Inspiration Can Come From Anywhere:** Share stories of families transformed by healthy eating, even if the initial inspiration comes from an unexpected source (like a child inspiring their parent).\n\n### I STILL FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IS THAT NORMAL?\n- **It's Normal:** Feeling like you should have done better is normal, and almost every client experiences it.\n- **Desire is Key:** The desire to want to do better is incredibly important. It's why you showed up for the program in the first place.\n- **Growth Mindset:** Your desire to do better is why you _will_ do better and continue to improve.\n- **Don't Strive for Perfection:** Don't feel like you've arrived and it's all done. That's a path to stagnation.\n- **Celebrate, Don't Beat Yourself Up:** If you feel like you could have done better, don't beat yourself up about it. Celebrate it.\n- **Take Action:** Ask yourself how you can improve and then take action.\n\n### DO I NEED TO TRACK MY FOOD GOING FORWARD?\n- **Not Required:** You don't _need_ to track your food going forward, unless you want to.\n- **Pattern Assessment:** Keeping a food journal can help with pattern assessment. It makes it easier to link what you ate to any consequences (like headaches) because our memory is often unreliable.\n- **Freedom is Key:** It's not a rigid requirement. Do it if you feel empowered by it.\n- **Easy Method: Private Messaging Group:** Create a private group on WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram (invite a friend and then remove them). Take photos of your meals and post them in the group. They'll be timestamped and dated, making it easy to scroll back and see what you've been eating.\n- **Authenticity is Important:** Unlike sharing on Instagram, this method is for your personal tracking, so be honest about what you're eating (even the \"Double Sunday\").\n\n### HOW DO I KEEP FOOD FROM BECOMING AN EMOTIONAL TOOL AGAIN WHEN STRESSFUL TIMES COME UP?\n- **Stressful Times Trigger Ancient Instincts:** Recognize that stressful times trigger ancient instincts to consume calories, even though those calories are no longer functional.\n- **Cookies Don't Help:** Understand that cookies and other junk food only distract you for a few minutes, then cause blood sugar irregularities, cravings, and amplify the pain.\n- **Carbs Can Increase Irritability:** Carbohydrate foods can make people more irritable, grumpy, or hungry due to sugar crashes.\n- **Masking, Not Dealing:** Using food to mask emotions is similar to using drugs or alcohol. It's not dealing with the problem.\n- **Get Tougher:** When times get tough, get tougher. Go into Spring or do a Winter fast to dial in your body, reduce inflammation and cravings, and improve blood sugar management.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17884, "end_char_idx": 22301, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dd21eca-6a31-4209-afdb-534d129ca5fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dd21eca-6a31-4209-afdb-534d129ca5fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 13.md", "file_name": "Week 13.md", "file_size": 25902, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a3e3b24-5dcc-48c1-8a09-d692a2c68ddd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 13.md", "file_name": "Week 13.md", "file_size": 25902, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "bbc087aae29f46279ba3e23611f7f6da03d619afc9ce73d9f4ea292eb1c0f2b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9357e02e-c563-478a-b984-fa77a2221dbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 13.md", "file_name": "Week 13.md", "file_size": 25902, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "0b8c280129e4a05cf819914482bba345b15f9570f5f4213b9d7cf280edfd0025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "### HOW DO I KEEP FOOD FROM BECOMING AN EMOTIONAL TOOL AGAIN WHEN STRESSFUL TIMES COME UP?\n- **Stressful Times Trigger Ancient Instincts:** Recognize that stressful times trigger ancient instincts to consume calories, even though those calories are no longer functional.\n- **Cookies Don't Help:** Understand that cookies and other junk food only distract you for a few minutes, then cause blood sugar irregularities, cravings, and amplify the pain.\n- **Carbs Can Increase Irritability:** Carbohydrate foods can make people more irritable, grumpy, or hungry due to sugar crashes.\n- **Masking, Not Dealing:** Using food to mask emotions is similar to using drugs or alcohol.

If you remove the brackets, the next sentence (day) will have the same problem.\n- **Experimentation and Course Corrections:** Refer to the Week 13 videos for guidance on experimentation and course corrections.\n- **Example: Pizza in Italy:** You might not regularly eat pizza, but you could have it as a parenthetical experience while traveling in Italy.\n- **Close the Parentheses:** When you return home, close the parentheses and return to your normal eating habits.\n- **Don't Change Your Identity:** Do not let the vacation change your identity. Vacation was parenthetical.\n\n### SHOULD I WEIGH MYSELF NOW THAT THE PROGRAM\u2019S OVER?\n- **It Depends:** I don't know, should you?\n- **Weight is Not the Best Indicator:** Weight is not a particularly good indicator of your health. Body composition is a bigger issue.\n- **Emotional Experience:** What is your emotional experience of standing on a scale?\n- **Avoid Stress:** If standing on a scale is stressful for you, don't do it very often.\n- **Check-In:** If you weighed yourself at the beginning and middle of the program, you might want to do it now to see where you ended up.\n- **Impossible to Judge on Weight Alone:** It is completely impossible to make a judgment on somebody purely on weight.\n- **Losing Fat, Gaining Muscle:** You can be losing fat and gaining weight (or not losing weight) due to increased muscle mass, body movement, and protein intake.\n- **Weigh Yourself If You Like:** Yes, you can weigh yourself if you like. If you find it stressful, don't do it so often.\n\n### CAN I REALLY DO THIS FOREVER?\n- **Not Totally Your Choice:** It's not entirely your choice anymore. The information and strategies you've learned will likely stay with you.\n- **To What Degree?** It's not a matter of _whether_ you will continue, but _to what degree_ you will continue.\n- **Permanent Changes:** Certain things will likely never go back to the way they were before.\n- **Power to Fix It:** You will always know that it's in your power to fix it if you stray off course.\n- **Course Corrections:** You will continue to make new course corrections and observe things you didn't notice before.\n- **Not a Diet, But a Changed Diet:** You didn't go on a diet; you worked to change your diet.\n- **Motivation and Reflection:** Your level of motivation, how closely you pay attention to your success and where you want to end up, and how often you reflect on what you want to avoid will influence your commitment.\n- **Surround Yourself Wisely:** The type of people you spend the majority of your time with will heavily influence your commitment.\n- **Be the Example:** By being the example you want to see in the world, you will stick with these ideals in a much stronger way.\n- **Vote with Your Dollars:** When you buy something, you are voting for that food to be made again. Choose wisely.\n- **Food Revolution:** By taking on the role of an official member of the food revolution, it will be easier for you to stay on track.\n- **Some Version of This Forever:** You're going to do some version of this forever.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21413, "end_char_idx": 25887, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8eb746bb-dec7-4ffd-a078-7cdec734d4d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8eb746bb-dec7-4ffd-a078-7cdec734d4d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 2.md", "file_name": "Week 2.md", "file_size": 15357, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9bd26163-a6e4-4a67-a816-9f6a70eba8b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 2.md", "file_name": "Week 2.md", "file_size": 15357, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "f88a7cebcfb85468d4456724a979fb429f9cb0f5eb25f5358c6ec73ea0c07735", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cade8bdf-28bf-4b5a-8fc9-72e123d7233e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc7069499e1686bf76448e1823f92073fc9cec06c4592425cf7ba0bfbc824141", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# WEEK 2\n## Day 1\nFood is a constant awareness for us all the time.\n\nThe more stressed we are, the harder it is to maintain consciousness regarding our food choices\n\nLast week we talked about reward repatterning, any behavior that you reward is likely to be repeated, so don't reward negative behavior with calorie rich foods.\n\nWe also looked into craving escape velocity, the levels are:\nSurrender: If you have the opportunity, you eat it\nStruggle: Sometimes you can use willpower to resist but eventually you give in\nDepravation: You can use willpower to resist it but you are constantly feeling that you are missing out, a feeling of lack\nAmbivalence: You are neutral most of the time, but on special occasions you might have it.\nDisinterest: You don't even care\nFood freedom: I don't even want it anymore, even in social or stressful situations.

The idea is to make your food intake conscious. Notice the experience.\n\nWhat is the food timeline?\nThe realization of how food makes you feel after you've eaten it. It's about connecting the consequences of your food decisions with the food itself, so that you make a conscious decision about eating them or not. The timeline starts with your emotions, before even eating the food.\n\nCan I use frozen fruit?\nYes, it is not optimal, fresh is better, but it's more convenient. Super cold food can slow your digestive system so see how do you feel with it. Also check the ingredients of your frozen fruit, avoid colorants and sugar.\n\nHow can I handle emotional eating?\nYou can handle it will willpower but it will not work. Better, understand it and we will lay a great foundation with you emotions and food, and the resulting consequences. You will never have to deal with emotional eating ever again because you will have consciousness and you will understand it. For now, be aware of it.\n\nWhy am I still eating what I was eating before?\nWe're here to create lasting change. We don't rely on diet industry tropes.\n\nWhat if I attempt to remove or reduce some of the foods I used to eat?\nLet's celebrate, you are moving through craving escape velocity. Remember, if you use willpower to resist a food, you are using an old diet industry trope, a failure strategy. Better, make sure to eat those foods for now, because when you have an emotional charge before eating the food, it makes the food experience taste better. If something is forbidden, and you give permission to eat it, it tastes much much better, which gives you a distorted view of really how good that food is.\n\nIf there is no rebellion, you don't get a big emotional payback and you realize those foods are not so good to begin with. Pay attention to your psychology, physiology and emotions.\n\nWhy does willpower fail?\nIt doesn't, it's supposed to work like it does, a short term solution before giving out. The food angel feels very strong when you make the decision with willpower that you will not have a food. But this is temporal, that is the nature of willpower.\n\nHow can I make the alkagizer in the easiest way?\nThis is not for the average blender, also you can create alkagizer smoothies and put them in an ice tray, and freeze them, and unfreeze them in the morning. this is also great for short term travel.\n\nWhat should I do if I'm craving unhealthy foods?\nJust eat it! At this stage we're only building consciousness. Food freedom is achieved by eating something, not by leaving it out. Don't binge, but play into your normal cravings. Notice the dialogue. Don't use willpower.\n\nWhat if I dissociate or eat unconsciously?\nThis is a normal human response. Right now we want to flip the consciousness dial on. It's normal to disassociate every now and then. But the more conscious you are, the faster your journey towards food freedom will be.\n\nWhat is the best way to eat fruit?\nEat the most naturally occurring fruit you can, avoid genetically modified food. Eat it in the morning, with the stomach empty. In what forms? The more natural the better, chewing is best, blending is okay. Don't juice the fruits, because you are only getting the water and the sugar, and leaving out the fiber and nutrients.\n\nI feel hungrier than before.

This is the best form for our digestive systems. We don't have to do that, but it's something that happens.\nIt's okay for you to have occasional sugar spikes if it is in season\n\n### Video\nDifference between craving and hunger, hunger is something that comes within you from a nutritional perspective. Cravings are more emotional. That's why we have the 6 human hungers.\n\nReal hunger, nutritional hunger is when your body is missing something, nutrient, minerals, amino-acids, proteins, fat. Everything else is related to the six hungers.\n\nThirst, we get so much water from the food that we eat. If you drink water preemptively this is a way to satisfy this hunger.\n\nLow blood sugar hunger. This happens with carbohydrates, bread, pasta, fruit, candy. When you eat sugar, your body produces insulin to break that sugar down. After eating sweet, you might end up with low blood sugar and high insulin, this is an evolutionary trick to make sure you ate enough so that you survive the winter. Notice the food timeline 1 hour after you eat a carbohydrate rich food, notice the spike of energy and the crash.\n\nEmpty stomach hunger. Empty stomach and hunger are different things. At the morning notice how it feels.\n\nAncestral food rhythms: this is the idea that is't not simply what we eat that determines our health, but also when we eat it. This leads to seasonal eating, also the food combinations. Also, when our ancestors woke up in the morning, they didn't have food. They had an ancestral pattern of intermittent fasting.\n\nConsider before having breakfast some exercise or walking, and then when you had your last food of the day consider letting your stomach be empty so it cleanses for the next day. **This is optional.** But this boils down to your habits, if you want to try it. Wake up in the morning, have a glass of water, go for a walk or do some stretches, delay your breakfast a little bit. Then when you have your last meal at night, let yourself go to sleep with an empty stomach.\n\n## Day 3\nEven if a product has \"organic\", USDA, if they are processed, most likely is not good. Syrup, organic cane sugar. Fruit flavored snacks are not healthy at all even if they appear so.\n\nDon't assume the front of the package tells you if it is healthy.\n\nThe pressure to eat sometimes comes from the outside, from people who puts their beliefs unto us.\n\nThe food devil shapeshifts, using different arguments.\n\n### Video\nRight now don't resist food, you want the long term benefits. Much of the forbidden food triggers a biochemical response, which amplifies the pleasure response.\n\nWhy is food so hard to resist?\n\nThe people of our past:\nSince our childhood, certain people gave us foods that created emotional responses that would then drive your decisions in the future. You can link candy to love. Cookie = Love. Ice cream = sitting down.\n\nLook for those linkages so that you may start to break them, once you identify them they lose their power over you. When you have a specific craving, look into your past and identify what's the meaning behind the foods, the holidays, the person.\n\nThe linkages are powerful but bringing light into them takes their power away.\n\nThe people in our present:\nThe food devil is inside everyone. People can make you feel shame because \"you are on a diet?\", \"this is a special occasion\", \"everything in moderation\".\n\nAlso, the food manufacturers. The slogans are designed as hypnotic statements or chants.

Even sodas have salt, and a lot of sugar, this in order to make you thirsty so you need another one. Pay attention to where you might be manipulated.\n\nStart reading the ingredients on the label of the products you buy. If you can't pronounce it, it probably is not good for you. Notice how often sugar is in the label.\n\nWhat if you got angry at the food industry? What if you got angry at the ingredients they put on the food that they are selling? When you get angry, they lose their control over you.\n\nRemember reward repatterining. Only reward your productivity.\n\n## Day 4\nTobacco companies are manipulative and they used those same strategies in the food industry, with lobbying, with misleading labels. They are more interested in profits than in the food or in your health.\n\nRebel against the food industry. Keep an eye on manipulations, on ads, social media, ingredients, highlight them and share them with the community. One of the things that the food industry does is keep you confused, because if you are confused, you surrender.

This means ancestrally relevant foods, foods that humans have always eaten. Seasonally available fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and poultry. If you are a vegetarian add a variety of legumes and beans.\n\nStep 2:\nTake a break from certain foods that have begun to lose their control over you.\n\nStep 3:\nRecognize that your body has 3 metabolic modes, your body can burn sugar, burn fat, or burn protein. You have to figure out how to burn those through the year. These metabolic modes helped us evolve to survive through the seasons. You want to experience wildfit spring, where you will experience ketosis. Later you want to have summer or fall, ocassionally you may want to experience wildfit winter were you take a fast to prioritize on protein burning or autophagy, where you allow your body to clean itself out its old cells and old proteins.\n\nYou should not do this alone.\n\nKeep track of what's going on in your body. Keep track of your progress, and remind yourself of how things were like before.\n\nHold a very clear vision of your future, your success tableau and your rock bottom perspective.\n\nSomething that happens is as you are going through the program and you forget the pain you had before, the food devil comes back again.

Remember, this is a break from sugar, to understand all the changes your body will have.\n\nRead the ingredients label in the items you buy, so that you look out for sugar. Almost all processed foods have sugar, and it is in things you might not expect at all. Become the sugar Sherlock Holmes and find it whenever you can.\n\nIf you find something that you wanted to buy but you realize it has sugar, don't be sad, that will trigger depravation, be angry, be annoyed. Because they want you to get addicted, they want to drive profits. If you stop buying it, they will stop making it that way.\n\nIncrease your intake of fresh fruits and dry fruits if you have sugar cravings.\n\nUnderstand the psychology of sugar. When you encounter sugar, your body thinks that this is a rare thing that you need to eat as much as possible. This manipulates your brain. It creates a strong dopamine reaction, its objective is to make you remember when you got that sugar from so that you survive the winter.\n\nBe aware of how the processed foods that you ate go down the craving escape velocity.

Whenever you feel the restriction of the journey, and you start to think that before you had more freedom, that is an illusion. The food industry gives you the wrong food, that restriction was imposed by them, you should have been free all along.\n\nBe inspired by other's people successes.

This week you are avoiding the added sugars, not the nutritional content of the food.\n\n07 - WHY ARE MY SUGAR CRAVINGS SUDDENLY SO INTENSE?\nIt's psychological, look for the 6 hungers, also the taking a break can give you a craving fluctuation, if this happens increase the intake of fresh and dried fruit, it's best to have them on an empty stomach.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4277, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48ff7ff2-a232-4557-8535-69f0ab2bd5d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "48ff7ff2-a232-4557-8535-69f0ab2bd5d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 3.md", "file_name": "Week 3.md", "file_size": 9510, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d338a5a1-1d00-4796-b44d-73b1d64b5123", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 3.md", "file_name": "Week 3.md", "file_size": 9510, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "35798d556d0f053390b531ee4418822138d4cf5ce2ae1dee033e07ecbcee613f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "48f58dfd-8fc3-40e4-a1e9-495c5e108d3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 3.md", "file_name": "Week 3.md", "file_size": 9510, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "61b78816c1b44b23630d5a5bdfcafe262a4f1123784ad08f45005a52289e76dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08245721-815e-4312-9ac1-6a2b1f744628", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec14b618fbed7d86bb3a5995ba21eba9cdba3ea096409885ecd989a8a0905510", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If you really can't resist, have fruit instead of other carbs\n\n05 - CAN I USE HONEY OR NATURAL SWEETENERS THIS WEEK?\nYou can continue to use them as you used them before, don't increase them or use them as a substitute for sugar.\n\n06 - WHY DO SOME OF THE FOODS I EAT HAVE SUGAR IN THEM, WHEN I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD?\nSugar labeling is very tricky, you can observe the sugar content in the ingredient list and the nutritional table.

Look for another way to address the state in another non-food way.\n\n08 - I'M GETTING HEADACHES. IS THAT FROM GIVING UP SUGAR?\nYou are taking a break from sugar, not giving it up. It is possible you have withdrawal symptoms, but unlikely. Have enough water, minerals and fruit.\n\n09 - WHY DO I FEEL EMOTIONAL OR ON EDGE THIS WEEK?\nWe will have both physical addictions and emotional addictions. Some of those are born of the habit of addressing particular emotions with sugar. You might start having a feeling of restriction, but know it is temporary, you might have them again in a conscious manner. Have some water and listen to the meditation.\n\n10 - HOW STRICT DO I NEED TO BE ABOUT REMOVING SUGAR?\nBe diligent, militant. This will only work effectively if you don't let in sugar. Sugar is hidden in our food. Often bread, bacon, tomato sauce have sugar. Run this experiment properly.\n\n11 - WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I ACCIDENTALLY EAT SUGAR?\nDo the very best that you can, avoid it whenever possible. If you find out, stop in the moment. Your tastebuds will adapt to less sugar. If it happens after the fact, analyze your response, don't beat yourself. Do this the best that you can.\n\n12 - WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN IS RESISTING THIS PHASE?\nThis is the part of your brain that has resisted changing your relationship with food or going on a diet. This might cause your body to feel a bit uncomfortable. You have to know that in nature, sugar was something rare, now it is overabundant. Use a little bit of willpower to resist it in this phase if you have to.\n\n13 - HOW CAN I FEEL MOTIVATED WHEN I FEEL DISCOURAGED?\nSome of the discomfort is an echo from the past. Remember this is a break from refined sugar, not that you are going to never eat sugar again. Look into your success tableau and your negative motivation. Find the community and the coach.\n\n14 - HOW DO I DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESSURING ME TO EAT THE THINGS I'M\nAVOIDING RIGHT NOW?\nYour friends actually want to help you, saving you from a Diet, but they are repeating their own patterns and they will feel more comfortable if you repeat them as well. If you demonstrate positive steps towards a better life, you remind them of their poor decisions, and threaten their self esteem.\n\nDon't say \"I really shouldn't have that...\" say \"Oh, I am not eating that right now\", with confidence. You can speak to them in advance and say that you are running an experiment and taking a break from all refined sugars, and that you are asking them, as your friends, for support, to avoid refined sugars.\n\nWhen people make something \"out of love\" for you, it only works when it's something that you actually want. Not something that you hate. It's not that they want you to fail, it's just that they have also been manipulated by the food industry.\n\n## Day 5\nThe reason they put sugar in everywhere is because they want you to eat more.\nIf you are feeling restriction, know that this is temporary and food freedom awaits at the end.\n\nThis week's enhancements:\n- Continue away from refined sugar\n- Take a break from processed carbohydrates and grains\n- Take a break from dairy products (except butter)\n- Take a break from vegetable and seed oils\n\nContinue drinking the alkagizer and fruits.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3495, "end_char_idx": 7753, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08245721-815e-4312-9ac1-6a2b1f744628": {"__data__": {"id_": "08245721-815e-4312-9ac1-6a2b1f744628", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 3.md", "file_name": "Week 3.md", "file_size": 9510, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d338a5a1-1d00-4796-b44d-73b1d64b5123", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 3.md", "file_name": "Week 3.md", "file_size": 9510, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "35798d556d0f053390b531ee4418822138d4cf5ce2ae1dee033e07ecbcee613f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "48ff7ff2-a232-4557-8535-69f0ab2bd5d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 3.md", "file_name": "Week 3.md", "file_size": 9510, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "c1b263bd1b7f2d14580ee71e626db944df5a115042912935857f6fe87bc0b3e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "You can speak to them in advance and say that you are running an experiment and taking a break from all refined sugars, and that you are asking them, as your friends, for support, to avoid refined sugars.\n\nWhen people make something \"out of love\" for you, it only works when it's something that you actually want.

Grains are unnecessary.\n\nWhen giving up dairy products, people thought Eric was crazy.\nThe fact is that milk is good for you when you are a baby and you are drinking milk made by your species. It is specie's specifics and time specifics.\n\nAccording to the developmental cycle of the baby, the mother's milk formula changes according to what the baby needs. It's different in week 1 to week 9 to week 24.\n\nIf you are a human, you want your milk from a human and from the right week of development that you are. Once you are an adult you don't need it anymore.\n\nWatch the bonus video on dairy delusion.\nMost of the milk generated in the developed world is generated by cow farms where they are treated absolutely terrible, and have fed into them hormones.They develop antibiotic mastitis which is very painful and can't be treated, they are milking them anyway.\n\nIn the U.S. the milk industry asked the FDA to raise the acceptable levels of white blood cells in milk. (AKA infection). That milk is bothering you.\n\nThis next step might feel like a challenge,\u00a0**but remember, it\u2019s just a break**. The goal is\u00a0**observation, not deprivation.**\n\nThis is a very exciting phase of the challenge. It can be though but the payoff is absolutely fantastic.\n\nObserve your behavior and your response.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion out there regarding food, and that confusion is intentional because the more confused you are the more you surrender to the food industry.

Now, we are taking breaks, but probably it becomes easier the longer as you go.\n\nConsider this principle for the rest of your life:\n\"A menu in a restaurant is just a list of badly organized ingredients.\"\nYou can get creative. BE THAT PERSON, people who are \"that person\" are the ones who take care of their bodies. That person is less prone to develop diabetes, cancer, heart disease, inflammation.\n\nSpecies evolve with certain diets from their environment, a specimen of that species that eats their diet will be healthier than one that doesn't.\n\nEvery early human had carbohydrates, but which ones? They didn't have dairy. These things had new.\n\nThe carbs our ancestors did eat where seasonally available fruits, some vegetables and some nuts, beets and seeds, and honey. They didn't have bread, pasta or potatoes.\n\nStick with foods that your DNA and your gut bacteria has evolved to process.\n\nCarbs cause blood sugar issues if eaten constantly. Not always when your blood sugar spikes is bad, but when it happens constantly. Or the continual elevation of your blood sugar spike. The spike of your blood sugar is a perfectly natural response from eating carbs. Our ancestors have not daily, constant access to carbs. You are removing junk carbs.\n\nMilk is good for you when you are a baby and when it's for your species. You do not want the milk from other species. Why we drink cow milk, but not rat milk, kangaroo milk.\n\nRegarding seed oils. they cause inflammation and auto-immune conditions.\n\nAll of these 3 foods cause inflammation and auto-immune conditions, they are disastrous when consumed too often, too regularly and too much.\n\nWillpower is not a muscle to cause permanent change. It is a strength you use for temporary adjustments. This week as cravings comes up, build executive function. Every single time that you use it, it gets stronger.\n\nExternal resistance, when they know about it they will give you their opinion. You can ignore them for now. When they see you resisting stuff that they can't resist, it makes them feel small and that's why they want to make you do it. You will make them feel comfortable if you make the bad decision together with them.

You can use other substitutes like cauliflower rice or edamame pasta. But the more processed it is, be more careful and read the labels as companies add the substitute\n\nBut be careful to not get into the habit of just substituting things for less tasty and more expensive variants.

The highest dairy consumption countries in the world also have the highest levels of osteoporosis and hip fracture. In Asia and Africa where dairy is not consumed as much, they have much much lower levels of osteoporosis.\nCancer risks go up with dairy consumption, men are much more at risk to develop prostate cancer with higher dairy consumption. In women, consumption of capsaicin increases the hormone IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) that is linked to triggering breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nCalcium regulation system: Milk raises your levels of acidity in your blood, which causes calcium to be taken out of your bones to alkalize it. The histamines in your body go to great lengths to defend your body when you drink milk. Milk drains calcium from your body.\n\nWe've been hypnotized to accept cow milk, but not other specie's milk. Also, mammals produce different kinds of milk week by week. So when you are drinking a cow's milk, from what week was that milk? Milk is a perfect food for a baby of that species for that specific week, no one else.\n\nThose hormones have an impact on you. They have instructions for your system, and we wonder why children develop earlier menstrual cycles, earlier development of breasts.\n\nAlso, in order to get a cow to make milk, they have to make it pregnant, then, when the calf is born, they take it away and get the milk. The calfs are tortured and slaughtered. And also, hormones are injected to the cow to make its organism think it still has to secrete milk, that cow has become a slave to the milk industry. Also, those cows develop mastitis, and the bacteria that causes mastitis has developed resistance to antibiotics. So you are drinking that infection and pus.\n\nThe first issue with drinking milk is lactose intolerance. It causes pain in the stomach, diarrhoea. When your body reacts badly to milk, it is a warning that it is not for you, and even if you are lactose tolerant, it does not mean it is good for you, it has long term effects like sinuses infection, acne, digestive problems.\n\nNo dairy means you may stop being allergic to certain things you were before.\n\n\"ELIMINATING DAIRY PRODUCTS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATORY MARKERS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE\"\n\nWhat if it's raw milk?\nNo, we don't have a evolutionary relationship with milk.\n\nA1 vs A2 milk is the same thing, even if you don't have immediate symptoms it does not mean is good for you\n\nMILK IS THE PERFECT FOOD FOR THE SPECIES THAT PRODUCES IT.\n\nWhy we believe it's so good? Because the dairy industry has manipulated us since childhood in order to believe that. DAIRY LOBBYISTS HAVE INFLUENCED GOVERNMENT DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR DECADES.\n\nDairy is NOT imperative for your health. Dairy is NOT good for your bones. Dairy is bad for your health. Milk and dairy is best avoided.\n\nUsually, the first time a person drinks milk, they vomit it, and that's why they gave us milk when we were young so we don't remember the vomiting.\n\n## Day 3\n\n### No Gain from Grain\nBread is basically empty calories with no nutritional value of any kind.\n\nGrains have played a big part of our development with the invention of agriculture, before that we were hunter-gatherers.

This was a great way to not starve, and this allowed the development of society.\n\nThis change meant that you did not have to walk so much to get your calories, which means you are not walking enough. \"If you are not using it, you are going to lose it.\"\n\nWhen agriculture happened, the storage of food happened, enabling us to store calories to survive environmental conditions and not starve, this does not mean well-nourished, but this meant you survived.\n\nPopulation starts to increase and sickness becomes more acceptable, at the expense of the individual.\n\nSore throats have a function, once your body starts to fight a patogen, the last thing your body needs is for you to be putting stuff in, so it inflames your tonsils (anginas). It does not want to spend time digesting, and you enter a nature induced fast for your body to heal properly. You should get lots of fluid there.\n\nSo wheat and seeds, and their enzyme blockers make digestion very difficult, their gluten causes pain in us, and the hormone triggers causes a lot of digestive issues. We can extract empty calories from them, but there is no nutritional value.\n\nThey cause celiac disease, digestive problems, intestinal pain. When you eat bread, you slow down your digestion and it makes you want to eat more because there is no nutrients there, that's your nutritional hunger talking.\n\nGrain is though on our digestive systems, and the thing with flour is that when mixed with liquids, turns into \"cement\", and it's very difficult to get out of things. Imagine how it gets stuck in your intestines, and how it causes stiffness, irritation, and removes some of the nutrient absorbing layers of your intestines.\n\nYour body needs time to cleanse if you eat them. Grains are not part of the human diet.\n\n## Day 4\n\n### FAQ\n#### Can we use butter or ghee?\nYes, we don't use dairy, but as fats go, we have a limited choice to the fats that we can use for cooking, the worst are vegetable oils and seed oils. Coconut oil, avocado oil and olive oil, are great. Most of the things that are harmful of dairy products have been cooked out or processed out of butter and ghee. Ghee is cleared butter where the lactose has been cooked out.\n\n#### What can I use instead of milk?\nYou don't need milk, so you don't need a substitute with milk, but if you want to, not any of them are particularly good for you, just not as harmful.\n\nAlmond milk, but be careful of seed oils and added sugars. Also, the brown shell of almonds contain lectins, which can be hard on the digestive system and not ideal.\n\nSoy milk: Very high in estrogen\nOat milk: Very high in carbohydrates\nCoconut milk Has sugar in it\n\nEach one has its own challenges, but none as bad as dairy milk. Why do you need an alternative at all?\n\n#### How will this affect my baby?\nMilk is species specific and developmental specific. Look for solutions if you can't breast feed your baby.\n\n#### Can I use bone broth soup?\nYes, this is a very welcome addition, Eric loves it as a snack and for breaking out of fast. It's incredibly satiating, 1 cup can give you a powerful sense of fullness. \n\nExperiment with it!!\n#### Is sugar free gum ok?\nAny time that something says \"sugar free\", and it tastes like sugar, it is full of other things that are not ideal for you.\n\nDon't add it.\n#### My over-the-counter drugs have sugar in them. Should I keep taking them or find an alternative?\nMany medications have sugar in them! If you require it, find an alternative that doesn't have sugar in it.\n\nOver the next few weeks you may find that the symptoms that made you go to that medication begin to diminish, and maybe you will stop needing it.\n\n#### How should I handle the removal of dairy products and grains?\nWe are just taking a vacation for now, don't eat them. Recognize that they involve our comfort foods, our emotional eating.\n\nYou may feel some emotional emptiness, but remember it is temporary, and a very powerful step towards food freedom.

Recognize that they involve our comfort foods, our emotional eating.\n\nYou may feel some emotional emptiness, but remember it is temporary, and a very powerful step towards food freedom. And this foods are designed to take your freedom away. In the future you may choose to have them consciously.\n\nThe harder you think this may be, the more you need to do it. the more challenging you find it, the more necessary it was for your physiology and psychology.\n\n#### Are there extra resources about dairy products and grains?\nThere are bonus videos and a PDF.\n#### What should I do about not emotional eating?\nMany of our comfort foods are in the grain and dairy category. You may need to use a tiny bit of willpower and a decision to not eat it now because you are taking a holiday from those foods.\n\nRemember: Those foods never address those emotional needs in the first place, just distract you from them. And even made the problem worse. This foods never address your emotional needs and never will.\n\nLook at the food timeline and see which emotions trigger which cravings, and ask yourself \"what else can I do to address this emotional need, that does not involve food?\"\n\nCall a friend, go out, spend some time with your children, take out your pet. Do the real things that your emotions are asking you to.\n\nRemember that there is a community with recipe ideas that are wildfit friendly. Alternative flours.\n\nYou did not develop certain nutrition habits by yourself, they were taught to you, put in the marketing and lobbying, and your social community.\n#### You're asking us to take a break from milk, but I heard A2 milk was good?\nA2 milk still has lactose. It's for baby cows, not for you. Some influencers just want to drink milk. And just because it doesn't hurt you doesn't mean it's okay or that it will not hurt you in the long term.\n\nMilk has lactose, lactose is sugar, you can't break down lactose unless you have lactates, which most humans don't have. But this does not mean it's good for them.\n\n## Day 5\n\n### Strengthening your food freedom\nThe average people sticks to diets for around 7 days, you are now 4 times that in the WildFit program!\n\nThis week you might have felt a bit of restriction. How are you feeling?\n\nAt this stage of the program, your neurology is starting to change, and you've probably bumped into temptations and suggestions from other people to get out of the holiday that you are on. Every single time that you refused, it becomes easier for the future.\n\nHave you felt any withdrawal symptoms? Any cleansing?\n\nHave you noticed that some people have been resistant to the changes you have been doing? Don't make big announcements or try to convince them that you are doing WildFit and that they should too. Friends are far less likely to try to derail an experiment than a diet. But you are not on a diet. But if you make big announcements to people, they even try to look to see if you slip in and fail. Be the change you want to see in the world.\n\nEnhancements:\nContinue the break from:\n- Dairy\n- Processed grains\n- Seed and vegetable oils\n- Refined sugar\n\nStart a break from:\n- Processed foods (packaged or processed)\n- Alcohol\n\nThere is nothing redeeming from alcohol, it does nothing good from you.\n\nHaving one small drink every day is worse than having a Saturday drinking night, as that gives your body more days to recover from the damage.

Top up your hydration and nutrition.\n\n### No bread\u2026 but what instead?\nFor many people, taking a break from bread can be a challenging step. We have bread for breakfast, bread for lunch, so what are you supposed to eat instead?\n\nOf course, there are countless options, but it might take a little creativity at first. The internet is full of recipes, and there\u2019s no shortage of cookbooks either.

Did you jump in right away, ease in, or wait until the last moment? Notice how your food devil is adapting\u2014getting weaker but maybe also trickier. If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0**revisit the Food Devil Personalities video**\u00a0to stay ahead of it.\n\n**Sticking with the Holidays**\n\nThis week, we\u2019re staying the course. That means continuing our break from:\n\n\u2705 Sugar  \n\u2705 Grains  \n\u2705 Dairy  \n\u2705 Processed foods  \n\u2705 Alcohol\n\nOptional breaks:\n\u2705 Caffeine\n\u2705 Nicotine\n\nAt this point, you might be feeling a sense of restriction.\u00a0Your life may start to be disrupted by this process\n\nYou might have gotten into a restaurant and be \"that person\", or how your family cooks something for you and you tell them how you want it. Or that your emotions might be up and down because you are not going to your confort foods.\n\n**That\u2019s normal.**\u00a0But it\u2019s also a sign of just how close you are to a major breakthrough. Keep an eye on the\u00a0**small victories**\u2014less cravings, more control, stronger decision-making. You are\u00a0**rewiring your relationship with food.**\n\nYou are making progress, you are making a substantial change that will improve your quality of life for the rest of your life.\n\n**Cravings are fading. Control is strengthening.**\n\nKeep going, you have gone so far. Don't surrender to the food industry. When we stop buying it, they stop making it.\n\nStay the course, keep checking in, and lean on the community for support. You\u2019re doing incredible work\u2014keep going!\n\nRemember why we are taking the holidays:\nThere's food, and then there are other things. Back in nature we would not see plastic wraps, processed things.\n\nA lot of things they serve you is not food. Junk food should have been called \"Non-food\".\n\nIf we even have those foods to begin with, it should be an occasional thing, and done with consciousness.\n\nAlso, a lot of foods you had before had stimulants in it. And when you take a lot of them to make you feel good, you start to lose the ability to make yourself feel good.\n\nIn these foods you are taking a break from you there are addictive substances, they are there to remove your choice, to make yourself addicted to it. They don't want you to take a break, to lose their grip on you. Lifestyle disease is a very bad term, it comes from food and tobacco companies shifting the blame from them and their bad products, marketing and manipulation to you.\n\nThey did this to us, and what you are doing helps you, your family and society.\n\n### Bonus video: Food Devils\nYou have a food devil and a food angel, and they both debate, these debates get more intense if you are feeling thirsty or hungry.\n\nSometimes our food angels are weak at winning the argument, because they were trained weakly by society and our parents. A strategy shown is a strategy blown.\n\nThis is why we want to know the strategies of the food industry and the food devils. We want to get to the point that you don't get cravings for non-functional food, you just acknowledge and accept them.\n\nFood Devils:\nThe bully: \"You are going to give in anyway\", \"you never succeed at this\", \"you might as well give up now\"\nThe placator: \"Oh, but you've been doing so well\", \"You've been working so hard\", \"you deserve some kind of reward\"\nThe teenager: \"Well, everybody else is having them\", \"I don't care what that diet says\"\nThe toddler: \"I really want cookies\", \"I feel so bad\"\nThe drug dealer: Wants to get you hooked. \"Yeah, you should eat healthy, but let's just have one bite.\" \"just taste it\", \"just one more\"\nThe people pleaser: \"I feel so bad, they made it for us\", \"they made it with love\", \"I don't want to hurt their feelings\" (they are blaming the other person, if you eat it it's because you want it.

And because your body has accustomed to it, the removal gives your body an opportunity to readjust. There can also be an emotional component to it.\n\nKnow that this too shall pass, reseting your metabolism is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself.\n\n#### HOW LONG WILL CAFFEINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS LAST?\nFairly quickly, don't take painkillers, ride it out. Drink lots of water, meditate.\n\n#### WHAT SHOULD I DRINK INSTEAD OF COFFEE OR TEA?\nDon't drink decaf coffee, the chemicals they use to remove the caffeine are bad for you as well. Also proper tea is caffeinated. You can drink:\n- Roibos tea from South Africa\n- The best one by far is just water.\n\nMost teas make you pee more, thus you lose water.\n\n#### HOW DO I MANAGE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WITHOUT ALCOHOL?\nAlcohol is deceitful. It has social pressure and a low grade social anxiety, so alcohol is a social lubricant for them. Just say you are taking a break from alcohol right now.\n\nPush yourself a little, socially. Be outside your confort zone. Expand your social circle.\n\n#### WHY DO I FEEL MORE EMOTIONAL OR IRRITABLE THIS WEEK?\nIf there is a substance you have an addiction, there might be withdrawal symptoms and emotional fluctuation. Your inner child can be annoyed as well.\n\nRemember, this process is a jailbreak. Know this will pass. And be mad at the food industry for making you feel like that.\n\n#### WHAT IF I SLIP UP AND HAVE COFFEE, ALCOHOL OR PROCESSED FOOD THIS WEEK?\nIdeally, you won't slip up. Wildfit is all about freedom. If you take a sideway, call it an \"experiment\", the only bad experiment one that either you don't pay attention to, or that you don't run effectively. Slow it down, notice what has been going on in this experiment, how did you really feel, what the consequences were and how you felt afterwards.\n\nYou may even find that an experiment is what makes you go towards your freedom. \n\nBut remember: Experiments are not experiments if you run them over and over and over. Then make an absolute commitment to not run that experiment again for the next few days. So that you don't get a cascading effect or even worse, a complete departure from what you are achieving right now.\n\n#### \u00a0WILL TAKING A BREAK FROM NICOTINE AND CAFFEINE AFFECT MY FOCUS AND PRODUCTIVITY?\nIt could, they help you get focus until the withdrawal symptom kicks in.\n\nCaffeine helps when you really, actually need it. If you have an important meeting after a long flight, or driving when you are tired. Just take it once.\n\nAny distraction from these exercises will pass.\n\n#### \u00a0I THOUGHT I'D FEEL BETTER BY NOW. WHY DON'T I?\nIs \"nothing\" better? Any reduction in cravings, better sleep, any improvements? Any progress towards your specific goal?\n\nSee how far we've come. All the things you have done. You've made phenomenal progress.\n\nIt likely took you decades to create the conditions you want to reverse, remember we are a month into this journey.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6643, "end_char_idx": 10855, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd1cea5-342b-40eb-b30d-46819f029fb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd1cea5-342b-40eb-b30d-46819f029fb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 5.md", "file_name": "Week 5.md", "file_size": 19460, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5ecd74e-f4a9-4056-8f2b-611443f77ad7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 5.md", "file_name": "Week 5.md", "file_size": 19460, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "cc1afcb4e5547595490ed3d94cf4491acfadd2815716f9ef290a78e190ddb49a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ded39763-ccee-4cfb-a15c-503eb8f36239", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 5.md", "file_name": "Week 5.md", "file_size": 19460, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "34dca166c0bb4cb5b0f0fd91a4a825765152dc40067889fb50b0993265f39a78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b208942a-dd94-48db-83f7-37b0c5131234", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aeff4892679523415a70cbc62b57f21c06f6115d77380eb35080617c0c1eeb15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "#### \u00a0WILL TAKING A BREAK FROM NICOTINE AND CAFFEINE AFFECT MY FOCUS AND PRODUCTIVITY?\nIt could, they help you get focus until the withdrawal symptom kicks in.\n\nCaffeine helps when you really, actually need it.

You can erase many of the damages of decades in these 3 months. Hang in there. Look at the progress you've done.\n\n#### WHY DO I STILL CRAVE SOME OF THE FOODS WE'VE GIVEN UP?\nCravings can be physiological, emotional or psychological. And we are working on all of them.\n\nAre the cravings as strong as they were before? Most likely not.\n\nYou are now on the craving escape velocity, things can take more time to go lower up to point zero. Some can take longer.\n\nThis program can make near miraculous levels of change. For now, notice how your cravings are starting to come down.\n\n#### HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M MAKING REAL PROGRESS?\nIt may be you are making progress, but not just about for the main goal you have. If you are fixated on that, for example if your goal was to release weight. It may not look like you are becoming any closer.\n\nIn these cases, you want to look to the weeks before and all the progress that you've made on your consciousness.\n\nYou are now much further into this program than any regular person on a normal diet. Keep up the good work.\n\nThat mountain it feels like it's not getting any closer, then boom, you are on it. Hang in there.\n\n## Day 3\n### Taking a break from alcohol\nAlcohol is not inherently evil, this is merely about biology. Alcohol simply put, is a form of sugar. And we are working on a metabolic reset in Wildfit, so how your body processes sugar, this includes alcohol.\n\nIf the idea of not drinking feels bad, then that is a powerful sign you need a break from it.\n\nAlcohol is a form of sugar with psychoactive effects, it interferes with liver function, spikes blood sugar, it disrupts sleep. **The WHO stated that no amount of alcohol is good for health**, even small amounts increase your risk of cancer, specially breast and colon cancer.\n\nBefore, they claimed a glass of red wine was good for your health and your heart, which was not true.\n\nAlcohol is really really new to human bodies. And it's been locked down into our culture and added to our events to create dependency. Culture has made it awkward to say no to champagne during a wedding toast or refuse wine during communion.\n\nWe want to be aware and conscious with our relationship with alcohol. If you need it to relax, to socialize and to have fun, you have a dependency.\n\nInitially, alcohol seems like a tool, until it becomes a necessity.\n\nSome people can't have fun without it, because it becomes their social crutch. Remember, alcohol shortens your life.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to give up alcohol forever. But you\u00a0_do_\u00a0deserve the clarity and confidence that comes from having a conscious relationship with it. Let\u2019s reset, reconnect \u2014 and maybe even reimagine how alcohol fits into your life.\n\n## Day 5\n### Foundations Laid. Freedom Ahead\nYou've laid a foundation before we made our decisions regarding food, and that's what made the escape a little easier. We completed the setup.\nThe first 2 weeks are the psychological foundations. The next 3 weeks are for taking break from foods that are not ideal.\n(even root vegetables might taste sweet to you now!)\nThe diet industry is focused on taking foods away. We need a conversation on proper nutrition, evolutionary biology and science. Every species on earth has an evolved diet, each one needs certain nutrients and process its nutrients differently.

We were removed from our natural way of life and put in the modern world. We have given our body a chance to cleanse.\n\nWhat is our natural diet? People and the food industry want you confused with this, but there's no need to be, look at archaeological records, which clearly indicate what we have eaten, we have eaten:\nSeasonally available fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, poultry, beans and legumes.\n\nYou can also look at modern day hunter-gatherer tribes in Africa, they eat:\nSeasonally available fruits and vegetables\nMeat, fish, eggs, and poultry\n\nThere are also animals very similar to us, chimpanzees and bonobos, we share a lot of DNA with them, and what do they eat?\n- Seasonally available fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beets\n- Meat, fish, eggs, and poultry\n\nIt's the same!\n\nThere was never confusion, but it was created by the food industry. We will start talking about metabolism. We will do a Metabolic Reset.\n\nBears, they hibernate in winter, but to survive that much time without food, the previous season, the fall, they eat a lot of what is available to them, salmon, berries and honey, to prepare themselves for the winter. Now what would happen if we trapped a bear in fall? it would become obese, develop insulin sensitivity problems, and diabetes.\n\nAlso us, we have been trapped in the wrong season, this was our \"junk food\" fall, the seasons that our ancestors lived in were 4:\n\n- Winter: Though, calorie restriction due to drought, very little food around, very though season to survive. A lot of humans died here, and in order to survive it we prepared the season before (fall). We fasted here, for a little while the body burns fat but after a bit it switches to burning protein, this is called autophagy, it's not a bad thing. It burns old, broken proteins and amionacid chains, it burns the old, sick and diseased cells out. This is a great anti-cancer protocol, and nature forced it upon us every year. \n- Fall: Here we ate berries, seasonal fruits, root vegetables and honey. Our blood sugar level spiked, and we had our appetite increased, the more carbs we ate the more cravings we had, so that we fattened up and survive the winter.\n- Summer: It isn't so much a separate season, it is like an audition to fall, the early summer berries come out and ease you into eating carbs again, because they can be quite shocking. The same like in fall, your job is to fatten up for the winter.\n- Spring: Carbohydrates are not available, here you release the excess kilos you gained in the fall to survive the winter, and here the body moves to fat burning mode, ketosis. When you burn fat, you have a steady flow of energy, with sugar you get ups and downs, and you get \"hangry\". In ketosis you have steady mental clarity, its a wonderful place to be in.\n\nThese are not the seasons where you live, this were the seasons were our ancestors spent the vast majority of evolution, this was Subsaharan Africa.

When you burn fat, you have a steady flow of energy, with sugar you get ups and downs, and you get \"hangry\". In ketosis you have steady mental clarity, its a wonderful place to be in.\n\nThese are not the seasons where you live, this were the seasons were our ancestors spent the vast majority of evolution, this was Subsaharan Africa. With seasons, the types of food changed\n\nIn Spring, rain comes back, the plants start to grow again, and hunting becomes prolific. We turned from a season of lack, to a season of incredible abundance, food was available a plenty.\n\nWe will activate the metabolic mode that sparks ketosis in your body. But this is not the Keto diet!\n\nThe keto diet is the idea that just because something is really really good, it doesn't mean that it's good all of the time, ketosis is your body's natural response to an absence of carbohydrates, which is something mother nature did to us all the time, and your body reacted appropriately to.\n\nSpring starts next Monday.\n\nWhat puts your body in this metabolic reset is the absence of all carbohydrates.\nFruit is out of season, root vegetables are no longer to be found.\nWe are left with:\n- Non-carbohydrate vegetables\n- Very rare non-carbohydrate fruits like avocados\n- Meat, fish, eggs, poultry\n\nThere are 3 different ways to going through spring:\n- Standard spring: Just taking a a holiday from the last remaining carbohydrates\n- Gatherer spring: For vegetarians\n- Hunter spring: For inflammation reduction, symptoms you want to get rid off and a deep metabolic reset. This is a fully carnivore diet, only for a short time. Outstanding.\n\nChoose your buffer zone wisely.\n\nJust 10% of people who do the keto diet do it to the point that they get any kind of results, because it is really difficult for them since they go straight from junk fall to ketosis, no foundation, no education, pure willpower.\n\nBut this time, you have all the foundations and you will be able to do it.\n\nMetabolic resent causes some symptoms for a small portion of people, could be skin rashes, cold or flu symptoms, headaches, sleep disruption. As you switch up your energy sources you start to need less sleep. Mood swings. If you experience ay of this discomforts, just say \"yes!\" my body is moving forward.

Hold on. In the diet industry they give you a restrictive diet similar to where we are now, only this time you are prepared.\n\nWe have spent two weeks examining our relationship with food, knowing our psychology, our food triggers. Being more conscious about our food intake. We started adding more of the good stuff, Then we spent 3 weeks making incremental adjustments each week. We have done all of this to prepare us for this moment, the metabolic reset.\n\nEven if you have done the keto diet before, this time is different. This is a huge shift, and a great way of saying goodbye to the diet industry for the rest of your life.\n\nThis week become the detective of the process. Remember, this is a break, but this week you might experience the highest degree of restriction. We are getting closer to food freedom.\n\nThis is a no complaint zone, request support if necessary.\n\nProgress this week is going to come in two forms:\n1. Uncomfortable: When you switch metabolic function your body activate some cleansing. As you cleanse fat, stored toxins also release and you have to cleanse them out as well. there are some cleansing side effects (they are signs of progress!):\n\t1. Different bathroom experiences, peeing more often or less often, there is a different color or smell. Your poo might be less solid or more solid, or looks more rare. All of this are just adjustments.\n\t2. Spring rash: A great sign, but only 10% experience it. It's uncomfortable and itchy.\n\t3. Cold symptoms: Sore throat. Soft flu. \"keto flu\".\n\t4. For women: Brings back menstruation if you are older.\n2. Comfortable:\n\t1. Increase and improvement of energy: It can happen suddenly, or slowly.\n\t2. Skin, hair and nail improvement.\n\t3. Improved sleep patterns: Sleeping shorter, but deeper and better.\n\t4. Increased mental clarity.\n\t5. Increased focus.\n\t6. Better memory.\n\t7. Better mood stabilization.\n\nLet's talk about the switch. Because it is safer to store some extra weight, to believe winter is coming.\n\nIt takes some arguing with the body to make the switch, and really give you this week to convince your body that this is not spring, that there is an abundance of food:\n1. Get out of diet mentality, this is not a week of calorie restriction. Don't get hungry, eat spring food. If you let yourself get hungry, your food devil will stand up and it will make everything harder. And nutritional hunger will get activated. Eat enough. Don't control your portion. \n2. The more stressed you are, the harder it is for you to release the weight, meditate and find calm.\n3. Hydrate, get massages\n4. Don't bother with the scale. Weighting yourself and not seeing numbers you like gives you cortisol, it raises stress levels in your body so it makes you hold on into fat.\n\nBe excited!\n### Live Call\nThis is the week that the magic starts, any progress in the past few weeks is a bonus.\n\nWith muscles, theres two ways to get two failures:\nSlowly, and a heavy weight at the start. The second one is better for your bones.\n\nIf you cant sleep or wake up at midnight, meditate, write on a journal. Celebrate that you have more time to sleep.\n\nGovernments treat water with chlorine and also the water passes through pipes. It's better to drink other water but if you don't have any choice, drink the tap water. The ideal is water from glass bottles.\n\nUric acid: Meat is not the problem, but metabolic imbalance is.\n\nWith low testosterone, don't fight cholesterol\n\n\n## Day 2\n### Live call - Joey\nMove your body, something light, walking or Yoga\nThe lower your stress is, the safer your body will feel to burn fat.\n\n### FAQ\n01 - CAN I USE UNSWEETENED COCONUT OR ALMOND MILK IN MY ALKAGIZER?\nNot the best idea in the world, be careful and look out for hidden sugars and vegetable oil.\n\n02 - WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE A BREAK FROM BEANS, LEGUMES AND FRUIT AS WE MOVE INTO SPRING?\nThey have carbohydrates. Fruit is high in them. Nuts, seeds and legumes are a bit different. Beans are convoluted to digest because of the protein and carbohydrates and that's why they cause gas.

Fruit is high in them. Nuts, seeds and legumes are a bit different. Beans are convoluted to digest because of the protein and carbohydrates and that's why they cause gas. Don't have a lot of them\n\n03 - WHAT HAPPENS IF I FEEL LOW ENERGY AS I'M GOING INTO SPRING?\nFor people who have never gotten into ketosis it's a bit hard at first. Move your body, make demands for it. People have different reactions to when their body believes its spring. Look for hidden carbs.\n\n04 - WHAT DO I DO IF MY OLD FOOD CRAVINGS COME SURGING BACK?\nThis is where you want the correct application of executive function - willpower, to help get you through this. Carbohydrates trigger appetite. You body can get into panic mode. The further and further you get from carbs, the lower and lower the cravings get.\n\nYour gut bacteria develops depending on the way you eat, so if you eat a lot of carbs then your bacteria focus on that. But if you stop, that gut bacteria starts to revolt at first, but the carb focused bacteria start to die off, and the craving for carbs starts to die away.\n\nThat is the physical craving, it is up to you to deal with the habitual and emotional craving, and even those will move away as you keep into spring.\n\n05 - DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS FOR EATING OUT WHILE YOU'RE IN SPRING?\nIt's hard to find spring-friendly food at restaurants. Remember, menus are a badly organized list of ingredients. They put carbohydrates because they trigger appetite.\n\nAssert yourself! Is your body worth it to you? Think about your success tableau. The waiter and the restaurant are there to serve you.\n\n06 - SPRING SEEMS PRETTY LIMITED. HOW CAN I HANDLE BOREDOM?\nRight now you are focused on proper traditional nutrition. Let's go back to our ancestors, you could be bored but you had to eat what was given to you. The variety we have been living in is not natural.\n\nInstead of seeking variety on the overall list of ingredients, think of the different ways you can prepare something.\n\n07 - HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE MY BODY TO ADJUST TO SPRING MODE?\nIt takes relative time to how you've been living, if you have never entered ketosis, it might take you a bit longer, the majority have the switch in this week, some in the second week, and in very rare cases on the third week.\n\nOnce you have done it once, it will become easier and easier over time. Your body gets used to it.\n\nTo speed up the process, exercise, walk enough to generate some sweat. This indicates your body to release energy.\n\n08 - HOW WILL I KNOW THAT I'VE SWITCHED OVER INTO SPRING MODE?\nSome people switch in a flash, others take longer and slower.\n\nSome effects are discomforting, like a keto rash, bathroom responses, varied sleep patterns.\nSome nice things are an increase in energy, your energy no longer dips in the afternoon. Craving for sweet things lowering. Your breath and mouth feel different. This is a change in fuel, you generate gasses depending on what you eat.\n\nYou can also get keto strips, you pee on them and they indicate if you have ketones in your pee. And, the more efficient your body gets at burning fat, the less ketones show up in your urine.\n\n09 - CAN I WORK OUT WHEN I'M IN SPRING MODE?\nYes, but often for women, intense exercise can generate cortisol and that prioritize the body on sugar burning instead of fat burning, so it might make the opposite.\n\nGenerally, start with light movements. Walking. Yoga.\n\nOr higher intensity, zumba classes, dance classes.\n\nFor men, you can do gym workouts.\n\n10 - WHAT IF I SLIP UP AND EAT SOME SUGAR, WILL THAT RUIN MY PROGRESS?\nIn a way, yes, but do the very best you can, this is not a time of experimentation. You have to communicate that fall is over, winter is over, and it's okay now to release weight.\n\nAvoid carbohydrates the best that you can.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3555, "end_char_idx": 7761, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2abcd100-0e58-4f42-99fa-a06a87c2395e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2abcd100-0e58-4f42-99fa-a06a87c2395e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 6.md", "file_name": "Week 6.md", "file_size": 11101, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6cea0b2f-aac9-4b85-ba9b-d326c75ce790", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 6.md", "file_name": "Week 6.md", "file_size": 11101, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "bd45e43cd0904cc6f7aab7553a060ed7b99b2b15cba493b01913446805f88841", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71bd7d2f-210a-4770-a26d-83f9069368fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 6.md", "file_name": "Week 6.md", "file_size": 11101, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "e040636a029191f1991e70520223174f4114e02a4f6b9f0a0875523d6fa2f95c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "And, the more efficient your body gets at burning fat, the less ketones show up in your urine.\n\n09 - CAN I WORK OUT WHEN I'M IN SPRING MODE?\nYes, but often for women, intense exercise can generate cortisol and that prioritize the body on sugar burning instead of fat burning, so it might make the opposite.\n\nGenerally, start with light movements.

If you eat something and afterwards you realize, that's fine, fail fast, see the observation, move on and go back to spring, this is better than letting it go back into a cascade.\n\n11 - WILL I LOSE WEIGHT IN SPRING MODE?\nThis is an ideal season to lose fat. Weight on its own is not an ideal indicator. You may find that you are building muscle and bone density at the same time you release fat.\n\nYou may not see immediate changes in the scale, but your body composition is better. It's about body composition. Not weight.\n\nIf your weight feels the same, notice how your clothes are fitting, the comments from other people.\n\n12 - WHY DO I FEEL EMOTIONAL OR IRRITABLE?\nIt's possible to feel this for a short while. in the past, as the carb numbers went down, people started to fight over what was left. This last for 3 to 5 days generally.\n\nRight now, your body is shifting its way in how it deals with energy, so it may have less energy for a bit, and that influences how you feel about things.\n\n13 - WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUNTER, GATHERER, AND REGULAR SPRING?\nHunter: Carnivore, plants fight back, meat doesn't. Doesn't eat any plants.\nGatherer: Vegetarian, have legumes, beans and nuts.\nRegular: Regular diet, eats both meat and vegetables.\n\n14 - I'M FEELING REALLY REALLY RESTRICTED. WILL I NEVER BE ABLE TO EAT THOSE FOODS AGAIN?\nWildfit are entirely about food freedom. There are some things you might want to avoid for the rest of your life. You choose how you eat. The end of the program is how you can implement this principles for the rest of your life.\n\nYou can bring back foods. Are you going to bring back junk food? it's up to you.\n\nThere are 4 core food categories:\n1. Essential: Long standing, ancestral seasonally available foods.\n2. Functional: Newer foods that might serve us, like new world foods, and changed fruits and vegetables. Like sweet potatoes or avocados.\n3. Occasional: They are not functional, only serve for special occasion, holidays. We might need a little willpower to not consume them regularly.\n4. Non-food: Foods that you choose you will never have anymore. Food arrives to here not by willpower, but by education and habits\n\nYou are empowered to decide what you will eat, what you will not eat ever again, or what you will eat occasionally.\n\n## Day 5\n### You\u2019re in the Tunnel. Keep Digging.\nHave you noticed any good changes? Energy, cravings, foods going through the food escape velocity.\nThings have a fuller flavor now. Your body is in repair mode, cleansing mode.\n\nThere are 3 camps:\n1. This is amazing, I am loving spring\n2. The maybe camp, some positive effects but not sure\n3. It's hard, I feel restricted\n\nIf you are in the negative or in the middle camp. There are onboarding and cleansing process. Remind yourself that this is part of the process. All these negative emotions are just speed bumps on the way to food freedom.\n\nThere are no more enhancements for this week!\nOptional enhancement:\n- Checking out a yoga or a pilates class, tai-chi. Something that has nice, slow, gentle, stretchy movements. Increase your movements! Move your lymphatic fluids to release your toxins from your body\n\nLook for signs that the food industry is looking to get you\n\nSo stay in the tunnel. Trust the process.

If you want to, go into a yoga or tai chi class.

Make sure your lymphatic system is running really well. Your muscles are the pump, movement was vital for our ancestors to get food and water.\n\nHeart disease is the number one killer now, cancer is number 2, diabetes is number 4.

This might be the first week that you get any real benefit of spring.\n\n02 - WHY DO I STILL FEEL TIRED AFTER A WEEK IN SPRING MODE?\nYou may feel tired if this is your first time ever on in a very long time, it takes time for the metabolic switch to come.  It takes a bit for the body to accept fall is over. If you eat any carbs now you will go back into \"winter is coming mode\".\n\nThis will get better and better every single time.\n\n03 - HOW DO I KNOW WHEN I'M FULLY IN FAT-BURNING MODE, OR IN KETOSIS?\nIf you start releasing weight, or if you don't, but you are getting smaller. There are also smaller signs, you breath and mouth might feel different. You may have a change in energy, or your energy dips are gone. \n\nYou taste things that before tasted less sweet are now a bit more sweet. \n\nYou can get a blood test, or a keto strip to pee on.

But understand, you are inches from gold, you have done all the hard work, you have laid all the foundation. To get you through this:\n1. Powerful executive function. You are making yourself stronger every time you make the right decision.\n2. Refocusing: Not focus on the hard things or if you are not dropping weight, start looking for every single example of potential progress. Sleep, energy, cravings, clothes getting bigger, more understanding about food, more aware, more free regarding food?\n\nIf you are feeling progress, your motivation goes up, if you can't find them, your motivation goes down and you might need to use a bit of willpower.\n\nThis is a tight spot of the tunnel, but we are not far. Hang in there! You are going to make it.\n\n05 - WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR STAYING MOTIVATED?\nLook for all the progress you are experiencing, psychological and physical progress.\n\nSee your success tableau, that moment so emotional and so inspiring that you want to keep going.

The gut bacteria might start to revolt since you are not having sugar.

You don't need their opinions now.\n\nBe the change you want to see, don't preach.\n\nThe only thing you want to communicate is the requests you need to have to facilitate the season you are in. You can even say that you are finding it difficult and ask for their help, and if they see you grab a piece of bread they have permission to remove it from your hands. This will make your friends that want you to give in, your best nutrition accountability partners.\n\nStand your ground. You are the one that has to live in your body, your consecuences, not them.\n\n08 - WHAT IS THE BIGGEST THING I SHOULD FOCUS ON TO MAKE THIS PHASE EASIER?\n1.

It helps to cleanse your body, the more the better. \n\nIf you are a woman, don't do intensive exercise, as it may cause stress in your body and indicate it to prioritize sugar burning.\n\nZumba classes, dancing, walking, yoga, pilates, moving with more intention.\n\n10 - ARE THERE HACKS FOR MAKING THIS WEEK EASIER?\n- Do not get hungry, have spring friendly snacks close by, and say hydrated\n- Magnesium supplements\n- Key: Community\n\n11 - HOW DO I HANDLE SLEEP ISSUES?\nYour sleep patterns might be affected by spring because of the increased energy.\nCheck the sleep meditation. Cool your room down, take a cold shower, don't see blue light at night.\n\nWhen your mind surfaces something, it is reminding you, this is because it is worried you might forget. Keep a notepad beside your bed, write it down and then you can relax.\n\n12 - WHY IS MY CANDIDA FLARING UP?\nCandida are little, tiny sugar monsters, gut bacteria that love to eat sugar. If you experiencing symptoms it's because they are dying off, that is a sign it is almost over.\n\n13 - IS CINNAMON OK AT THIS STAGE IN THE PROGRAM?\nIt is okay, just that we link it to sweet things, it is a flavorant.\n\n14 - CAN I STAY IN SPRING FOR LONGER?\nDon't worry about the program right now. And never transition out from spring until you know when you are going back into spring. Your psychology around food will change based on what you are eating.\n\nIf you come out and don't plan when to go back in, your psychology will change to start to eat carbs again, and the more you eat, the more of a carb monster you will turn to.\n\n## Day 5\n### Your Body's New Rhythm\nCongratulations on your second week! This is very exciting. This is not that either it is working or not, it's happening at stages... Focus on what is working for you?\nIs your psychology better, better self awareness, better relationship with food, are your cravings coming down? Do you have more energy? Focus on what works on you, not on what doesn't work.\n\nThere are no new enhancements, stay in spring.\n\nThe breakthroughs are going to keep coming or start to happen for you.\n\nOptional enhancement:\nCardiovascular fitness.\n\nIncrease your step count, seek out some steps, some hills, walk in nature, a light jog, something that increases your heart rhythm a little bit. Nothing to intense. Do things that are fun! Increase your cardiovascular output this week. This will help you push the switch this week!\n\nKeep tuning in. Keep watching the food dialogue.

Your tastebuds have started to recalibrate, and things that you never considered sweet before taste sweet, that is a very powerful step in your process.\n\nMore foods have started to go into the craving escape velocity. Some foods you may start to consider if you ever will eat certain foods again. You are dropping weight, and if not, you weight the same but now you have less fat and more muscle.\n\nShare your progress with other people! Share your victories! You are helping people by doing so.\n\nMany of you are starting to see the light out of the tunnel, others are still in the tunnel but you are sure you don't want to go back. This week there are no enhancements. The vast majority have made the switch.\n\nThis week is the stabilization of spring. Increase your cardio movement, get your heart and lungs pumped up, this will improve your metabolism, every day, 15 to 20 minutes at the minimum of moving your body, also move more.\n\nHealth categories:\n1. Doesn't have any weight to release, no symptomology, good body composition, healthy.\n2. Just outside of that, they have that last little bit of weight to release, they have some soft symptoms\n3. Someone who is medically obese or dealing with health challenges like diabetes, inflamation and pain.\n\nIn this week there is a bonus video only for people who are category one. If there is still weight you want to release then you don't want to put yourself in category one.\n\nBut \u2014 this is also the week where for some people, the novelty wears off, and the food dialogue might start getting a little louder. Old habits might try to sneak back in. That\u2019s normal.\n\nThis is why today is all about remembering why you\u2019re doing this \u2014 and tuning back into the incredible progress you\u2019ve already made.\n\nThis is the week to stay the course.\n\nYou\u2019re not just taking a break from certain foods \u2014 you\u2019re reprogramming your relationship with food altogether.\n\nKeep going. Keep noticing. Keep showing up.\n\nYou\u2019re doing something extraordinary.\n\n### Category 1 bonus video\nCategory 1 is por people with optimal health. Category 2 is for people who are not there yet but there is nothing so bad going on. Category 3 is obesity and with a lot of symptoms.\n\nYou decide your own category.\n\nIf you are in category 1, you might release more weight that you may want, for this you may want to increase your exercise and your fat intake. This will slow down the release. If you still don't want to do this, there is a modification for you.\n\nSpring is not only for weight release, its has other benefits as well.\n\nChanges:\n- Increase fat intake\n- Increase exercise, strength training.\n- Reintroduce root vegetables, not fruits, just a bit of them. (carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes)\n\nYou may want to do this now, or in the following weeks. Make this assessment each week and react accordingly.\n\n### Live Call\nHigher Uric acid and cholesterol is normal in spring since you are eating differently now, and when you get out of spring that will go down naturally.\n\nYou can stay in Spring a minimum of 2 weeks up to 6 weeks maximum.\n\nWe need water, and we need it the more natural way possible, Eric is against carbonated or sparkling water, because it has CO2 added to it. But if carbonated water is going to make you drink more water then drink it!\n\nDon\u2019t check your levels so much during the transitional period, but check them after that. Do them a few months after your transformation to see how your levels are compared to before your transformation.\n\nIn living Wildfit you can switch between regular spring or hunter spring.\n\nTomatoes are a new world plant, Eric doesn\u2019t eat them very often. He recommends eating the plants that will give you the least reactions.\n\nHunter spring and sun light are great for nails and hair strength.\n\nYour cells in your body listen to every word that you say.\n\nFor kidneys, avoid aged meat and processed meats.

And check it out later in life when the food industry wants to get back to you.\n\n###### 05 - WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CATEGORY 1 VIDEOS?\nThis are for category 1 people and they have released more weight than they want.\n\n###### 06 - HOW DO I HANDLE FOOD CRAVINGS?\nThey are almost certainly about emotional hunger. If a food craving comes up, look at the food timeline and check what is the triggering emotion that causes the craving. Connect with other people.\n\nYou are reward repaterning. Only reward high quality emotions and only with the best food. Retrain yourself with functional food or with another non-food activity.\n\n###### 07 - WILL MY CRAVINGS EVER COMPLETELY GO AWAY, OR WILL I ALWAYS HAVE TO MANAGE THEM?\nCraving escape velocity, you are going through a transition. Yes and no, there might be some foods that you will never want to go back to, and it will not require any major effort. Other foods you may not know yet, and there might be some deep seated food cravings that might show up in the future.\n\nEric's goal is that you move most of your foods through food escape velocity, and you'll experience food freedom during the program, or some months later.\n\nSome of your freedom will be won experimenting on the other side, not this week.\n\n###### 08 - WHY SHOULD I AVOID EXPERIMENTING OR SLIPPING THIS WEEK?\nBecause we are in spring, if you eat sugar your body instantly goes back to burning sugar, the minute you eat sugar your body will switch gears and moving it back to burning fat requires a lot more effort, this is not the time to eat carbs.\n\n###### 09 - IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL EMOTIONALLY DETACHED FROM FOOD I USED TO LOVE?\nThis is exactly the goal.

SOME DAYS I BARELY EAT, AND SOME DAYS I FEEL RAVENOUS?\nIn spring, for our ancestors it was a season of feast and famine. It's normal for you to have days that you don't eat a lot and days where you do.\n\n###### 11 - HOW DO I HANDLE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WHERE I FEEL TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY EAT?\nWe are wired to want to follow the group in order to not be separated and die. But now this won't happen, so stand your ground and be the change that you want to see in the world, stay the course.\n\nDon't preach, don't lecture, just be yourself and attract their curiosity. You can influence people like that. \n\n###### 12 - ARE SUPERFOODS NECESSARY?\nThe word superfood is just marketing garbage. The real \"super\" food is meat, it is nutrient dense and doesn't defend itself, because the animal already did that. \"Superfoods\" don't exist.\n\n###### 13 - WHY DO I FEEL SO MUCH ENERGY ON SOME DAYS, AND LOW ENERGY ON OTHERS?\nYou have a normalization, steadying of your energy. And it will be difficult to remember how low energy felt before. Perhaps you are having a bit of a low compared to a very great high, not to the lows you experienced before the program.\n\nMaybe if you eat more fatty meals you might get an increase of energy.\n\n###### 14 - WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON\u2019T WANT TO GO BACK TO EATING SOME OF THE FOODS WE\u2019VE ELIMINATED?\nWe did not eliminate any foods, we are taking a break. But yes! That was the goal.\n\nWe believe in a natural human diet, with seasonal changes. You can make a conscious decision to go back to summer and eat some carbs. But you NEVER get out of spring if you have not decided when you will be going back.\n\nIf you don't need or want to bring non-functional foods. Don't bring them back.\n\nBut don't worry to eat again carbs when you get out of spring. Remember seasonal independence and always know when you will go back to spring.\n\n###### 15 - WHAT IS MY BIGGEST SIGN THAT MY BODY HAS ADAPTED TO FAT BURNING?\nWeight melting off you, increased energy, increase general sense of mental and physical well being, increased sex drive, increase immunity. And the lack of cravings.\n\n## Day 5\n### The Magic of Metabolic Flexibility\nYou have been around 3 weeks on Spring but congratulations, but there might have been some boredom. But remember mother nature, it didn't care if you still wanted berries or if you didn't want to eat something, it is not Eric's fault that the food industry is making food available all the time.\n\nIf you feel stagnated and bored, create some variety in your life. Go rock climbing, walk in nature, do some salsa or bachata dancing, do something different, you don't need to get all of your variety from food. You have to satisfy this needs in other ways.\n\nIf you feel stuck, go with your coach, go with the community.\n\nWe are going to do another week of spring. There is also an optional movement enhancement.\n\nMuscle density is one of the most powerful influences on you living longer and better. \n\nEvery single day you tell your muscles one of 3 things:\n1. I don't care about you. And they get smaller\n2. I love you, I care about you. And they stay around the same.\n3. You need to be getter. You do this by using them up to and past their capacity with strength training.\n\nThe strength training is optional, but very helpful.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7232, "end_char_idx": 11389, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e185f27-da87-4e7d-a767-0b782494c41d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e185f27-da87-4e7d-a767-0b782494c41d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 8.md", "file_name": "Week 8.md", "file_size": 11720, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1444bcb5-890e-4b19-9ca4-95faae66a58f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 8.md", "file_name": "Week 8.md", "file_size": 11720, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "32267a75476472da0dd800a709300483fe8ccdd08f2077f846098db776d7c252", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9b4370c-3e02-4477-b500-fcf9b2a70757", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 8.md", "file_name": "Week 8.md", "file_size": 11720, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "18617f3ae9b35e3bb061103ee7a5e686e4d5eb0b8296e75730e78007af068065", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If you feel stagnated and bored, create some variety in your life.

I am going to be in spring forever.\n- I can still do this but I am curious when it will end.\n- When this will end? This is awful.\n\nSpring is a cleansing and regenerating season. As people move further and further from the pain that drove them to this program, their motivation starts to fade away. This week in particular think about where you started and where you are now. The pain, the hunger, the symptomps.\n\nThe cravings are vastly inferior from where they started 2 months ago. Contrast were you where before and where you are now. Compare beliefs, psychology, cravings before and now. Be careful and maintain a consciousness of what pain drove you to do this program.\n\nBe conscious of that success tableau, those moments in the future where you are healthy, full of energy. Also keep your rock bottom perspective for when the food devil comes knocking on your door, the possible conversation with the doctor. The aim is not only to get through this week, but do it life long.\n\nRemember that the food industry is not on your side, and that they are tracking you, there's the food delivery trap, the \"putting candy at the checkout register\" trap. Those traps can have one or two effects on you.\n1. Significantly create caving and desire on you. This happens by being sad that you can't eat them, having the feeling that you are restricted will impact on your willpower.\n2. Getting mad, thinking \"I don't want that\", look at the kind of people that shop in the fast food places, are those your people? Look at the manipulation that the food industry is doing. Respond with irritation and anger.\n\nYou are almost free, you are free. They will keep coming for you. Even after when you escape out of the tunnel the dogs and guards will keep coming to get you with advertisements, social media, disinformation, cognitive dissonance, lobbying. They will try everything to get you back.\n\nLater we will focus on how to keep free from that and keep your freedom.\n\nContinue to stay in spring. Don't stay only focused on one single outcome, look at all your progress.\n\nIf you are not releasing any weight now, you can talk to a coach. Our you can have fat bombs, the recipe is in the platform. This is a fat heavy snack that will jolt your system. This will mean to your body that there is abundance. Another thing is that maybe you have been eating too much fat, a lot of fatty meats, in that case, go leaner and try to bring down the fat quantity.\n\nThis week the optional enhancement is strength training to help you release energy from your body. This makes big energy demands on your body and makes it comfortable releasing that energy. This is about muscle and bone density. \n\n## Day 2\n### Live call\nEmotions want to be felt. Just feel an emotion, don't want to solve it, just learn from it. Know how does it feel and where does it feel.\n\nIf you feel weak you could probably lack minerals.\n\nAdd some more salt and trace mineral, take magnesium supplement.\n\nSpring makes you lose more minerals as usual.\n\nAdd a little bit of lemon in your water.\n\nIf you are tired you can try drinking more water or going for a walk.\n\nYou can get bone broth without sugar or potatoes.\n### FAQ\n01 - WHY ARE WE STILL IN SPRING WITH NO CHANGES THIS WEEK?\nThis is called metabolic reset. be careful for the food industry setting you traps. On friday there is a change.\n\n02 - HOW DO I KNOW HOW LONG I SHOULD STAY IN SPRING FOR?\nDepending on your health category, and what your optimization strategies look like.

If this happens to you then relax, this has to do with your beliefs around that number.\n\nStop blaming yourself, let it go. Don't weight yourself. Also you may be experiencing body recomposition.\n\nLook at your belt hook, your clothes or your face.\n\nLook for hidden sugars, eat enough, don't be in scarcity diet mentality.\n\nThe biggest thing is to relax\n\n04 - WHY DO I STILL EXPERIENCE OCCASIONAL CRAVINGS EVEN THOUGH I\u2019VE BEEN IN SPRING FOR SO LONG?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4348, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "213cfb58-f23b-4f9b-b140-00b1cb58b556": {"__data__": {"id_": "213cfb58-f23b-4f9b-b140-00b1cb58b556", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 9.md", "file_name": "Week 9.md", "file_size": 10947, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce92e760-0a8e-49b2-b965-c2491f18aebc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 9.md", "file_name": "Week 9.md", "file_size": 10947, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "90af322e3c39cbe51ac5858e8989e2b4abf14807111245e4aba247473644855b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18a9e275-6154-4e01-966e-658bac949c90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jorge/dev/me/wildfit-coach/wildfit_notes/Week 9.md", "file_name": "Week 9.md", "file_size": 10947, "creation_date": "2025-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-15"}, "hash": "d066c6e18b7ddbf35ce41193e6b365e17fa06c517ad03e3a397bb88e44ea8a02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "792acdc5-c199-4bc6-ae21-89410f1d9257", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e07bdc9a8511532f0452be942b8773bbd3450f2732c0abad4fa623ef00ea77ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "02 - HOW DO I KNOW HOW LONG I SHOULD STAY IN SPRING FOR?\nDepending on your health category, and what your optimization strategies look like.

One culprit is everlasting temptation, the food industry is always putting traps, and it can be hard to live in a world like this.\n\nThe more you feel that you are missing out, the more likely that your food devil will want to get it. Get mad when you see the traps, get mad. It will help you understand.\n\nLook at our emotions, you have been breaking those patterns, but they might still take more time to reset. If they resurface again, look at it as a craving echo, laugh at it, and move on.\n\n05 - HOW DO PEOPLE HANDLE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DON\u2019T WANT TO EAT OFF PLAN, BUT THEY FEEL PRESSURE TO?\nStick with it, be the change you want to see in your friends and family.\n\nIf they offer you something functional but out of season, say thank you and that you will take it in a few weeks.\n\nCommunicate effectively with people. \"I am not doing that right now\". I don't do that. And the best, the last one is to ask for help to those same people.\n\n06 - HOW DO I STAY MOTIVATED IF THE PROGRESS FEELS SLOW?\nYou probably are there to a certain degree, but ask for help from your coach. If there is literally zero progress, write to Eric.\n\n07 - WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR STAYING ON TRACK THIS WEEK?\nPay attention to your progress, find ways to create variety for spring. Build a community.\n\n08 - IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TOWARD FOOD I USED TO LOVE?\nYes, that is part of the goal. You might also have indifference towards certain functional foods. That will go away when you change into a different season.\n\n09 - HOW DO I HANDLE EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES WHEN IN SPRING?\nWe often turn to substances and food to distract us from what is happening in the now. Move your body.\n\nLife has tough days, and the most common reason why people can't stick with their diets is a bad day. But this will put in the wrong substances for the wrong psychology and make thing worse.\n\nThe best season for emotional turmoil is spring and winter. Because of better flow of energy and more stable emotional experiences.\n\n10 - WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I NEED LESS FOOD THAN BEFORE? IS MY METABOLISM SLOWING DOWN?\nCarbs stimulate appetite, if you don't eat them, those cravings start to go down, And you are also eating very nutrient dense foods that your body is satiated and you have been hydrating.\n\n11 - WHAT HAPPENS IF I WANT TO STAY IN SPRING MODE INDEFINITELY?\nNot a good idea.

We can burn sugar, fat, or protein. We can't burn all at the same time, we burn them relative to the season we are in. Every species has adapted to its environment.

We can burn sugar, fat, or protein. We can't burn all at the same time, we burn them relative to the season we are in. Every species has adapted to its environment. You even hear people talking about OMAD, one meal a day, but that is not going to work for us, that is not how our metabolism evolved. These are the seasons our metabolism evolved to:\n\n- Winter: Very difficult, drought, famine. Our bodies needed to prepare for that, the best way was to have stored water and stored energy in our body\n- Autumn: The season before winter, with calorie abundance, there's berries, and fruits, root vegetables, honey, it's carb season, it's incredible. If they did the right things in the carb season, they would survive the winter. (eat as much as they could find). The minute they started eating carbs they would experience cravings that made them go out and find more food. They developed low grade insulin sensitivity so they didn't burn all the sugar and store it as fat. Some of them would have developed some mood swings\n\nYou might think that winter was the season to release all the fat, but no, in calorie restriction your body goes into stress mode and won't want to release fat, because it doesn't know how much this restriction will last, so it becomes very conservative about releasing any fat, it will start burn protein, it first starts with old, sick proteins first, collagens, old skin cells, old cells in general.\n\nIt's an incredible cleansing opportunity. And then the rain would come crashing down, the green would start to show up, and then the animals starts to have their babies and the hunting becomes amazing and suddenly there's incredible abundance, and the body realizes that it doesn't have to burn its internal structures anymore, plus, I don't need to carry all this fat anymore! In fact, I want to let it go because without it I am an even better hunter.\n\nIt's not that we evolved these metabolism reactions to survive these seasons, but in each season the body does important work.\n\n- Spring is a fantastic season for regenerating and cleansing, with abundance. You go into fat burning mode.\n- Summer: We move into carb season, you will start to burn sugar, your psychology will start to change a bit, your gut bacteria will change a little bit, you will start to become a lot hungrier and a full time eater, constantly in the search of food.\n\nWhat would happen if we never did winter?\n\nI imagine 1 of 3 people would die of cancer, prolific levels of auto-immune disease and inflammation, this is not the only factor, but it is a major one.\n\nThis is where willpower comes in. Nature used to do it for us, now we have to use our own education and consciousness to make us move through these seasons.\n\nWith this in mind, this is an optional enhancement:\nDo a winter fast.\n\nIn a winter fast you will not eat any food. You'll have water and potentially bone broth soup if you are not ready for a full water fast.\n\nEric's invitation is that you do at least 1 day just to see how you feel. And if you feel well, potentially you do 2 days. The goal would be to do 3 days.\n\nWhy? When your body goes through the first 2 days of fasting, it will realize it is in winter and will switch to that protein burning mode, and it will start burning old, deceased, broken protein chains.\n\nThis is one of the most powerful anti cancer protocols you can adopt, Eric does this almost once a month.\n\nIt is pretty daunting. if this is too much for you, stick with spring for now, hang in there.\n\nIf at this stage you have had enough transformation, no problem. We'll talk about this next week.\n\nMake it minimum 1 day. The next goal might me 2 days, and the final goal is 3 full days.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6841, "end_char_idx": 10942, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
