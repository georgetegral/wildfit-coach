# WEEK 11
## Day 1
Remember why you started

When you are in spring, it is about rarely, but large meals, like hunting.

Autumn, carb season, you are in browsing season, this is when you want to fatten up to prepare for winter. So the more carbs you eat, the more cravings you generate and the more food awareness you generate.

This is why the food industry wants you in carb mode, to get you. For you to notice food more. Carbs take away your freedom, this is what they do. This is a survival mechanism, to eat more, see all the food opportunities and survive the winter.

Pay attention and feel your freedom fade away. But remember, never leave spring without knowing when are you going back into it. You want the experience of moving back and forth into seasons. Maintain your observations.

You may not want to move back into spring, but soon you will feel the benefits and remember why you did it.

## FAQ

01 - HOW DO I KNOW IF Iâ€™M READY TO TRANSITION OUT OF SPRING?
If you are not super comfortable coming in and out, do it, and then we will go back into spring. This is to develop your own wildfit independence.

02 - HOW SHOULD I START REINTRODUCING CARBOHYDRATE FOODS?
Do not go with processed, garbage carbohydrates, no refined sugar.

Start slowly with root vegetables, berries, lower in sugar.

Pay attention to how your body reacts, they are going to be amazing, and notice how the cravings start to come up, notice how the carbs start to take your freedom away. Carbs are designed to help you fatten up for the winter.

03 - WHAT IF I FEEL BAD AFTER REINTRODUCING SOME FOODS?
That would be incredible, pay attention to the food timeline. This will help you to carve out a real sense of freedom. Many people when the come out of spring and eat something, that's when they carve out their freedom.

If you had an adverse reaction to something you ate, take it as learning, it is important to record and learn from.

04 - HOW SHOULD I MOVE WITH THESE INTRODUCTIONS? SHOULD I EAT A LOT, SHOULD I EAT SLOWLY?
Start slowly with small quantities, and simply. just one ingredient, do this very slowly so you don't get an explosion of cravings, and you see what is going on. Also, the more complicated your meal is, the more harder it goes to your digestive system.

Also, if you complicate the meal, and you have an adverse reaction, you won't know what caused it, otherwise, you will have a much better learning opportunity.

05 - SHOULD I RE-INTRODUCE, OR CONTINUE HAVING MY ALKAGIZERS?
Continue having them, don't renitroduce the alkagizer mild. Do the one that's pure vegetables. It is also okay to not have alkagizer, it is better for you to eat your vegetables instead of blending them.

Important: Our ancestors never had consistent access to the same fruits and vegetables every day. They had a cyclical relationship with them, there is no perfect alkagizer, fruit or vegetable for every single day.

They are meant to be cicles, eat plants long enough to get the good. Not enough for the bad to accumulate. Every single plant has benefits and consequences, so be careful about that

06 - HOW SHOULD I HANDLE EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS AS I START ADDING CARBOHYDRATE FOODS BACK IN?
Carefully. The sugar monster is coming back in.

Any behavior or emotion that you reward is likely to be repeated, it is incredible important, because your body receives all carbohydrate foods as a reward, if you had a really bad day, that's not the day you want to have a handful of berries, don't reward a bad mood or an unproductive day with this big calorie explosion.

If you are having some adverse moods, and you reward your body with carbs, you are teaching your body that the path to those carbs is to have a bad emotional day. Carbs are best had in a celebratory fashion. Productivity, exercise, good news.

07 - HOW DO I STAY MOTIVATED IF MY RESULTS ARE SLOWING DOWN?
It can happen this week. Look at the larger picture. You are making incredible psychological progress, the focus of the program is lasting freedom, lasting results and lasting transformation, and food independence.

Watch your emotions and your internal dialogue this week.

08 - WHAT IF I WANT TO STAY IN SPRING FOR LONGER?
You can, do it supported. If you are not comfortable coming in and out of spring come out and we will go back in next week.

09 - THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABOUT METABOLIC RESET. AM I GOING TO RESET MY METABOLISM BADLY BY COMING OUT OF SPRING?
The idea is not to teach you, is to develop metabolic flexibility, so that your body adapts to autumn, spring, winter.

When people never had done keto or fasting before, the first time is very hard, the more times you do this, the more flexible your body becomes. Same thing with the fast.

And every time you make that switch, it becomes easier and better. Keep at it! Future times are easier, this is metabolic flexibility for your food freedom.

10 - CAN I EVER EAT OFF-PLAN FOODS AGAIN WITHOUT GUILT?
A telling question, never a food is "Wildfit approved", it can be recommended, ideal, not ideal.

The idea is that you create your own rules about what you eat and what you don't. The program is about freedom, there are no rules, but there are recommendations.

Can I ever have not recommended food again? Yes! This program is about freedom.

Note:
Some of the freedom that you will obtain in life will come after you experiment with something.

Later, we will talk about how to make experiments. So you eat it and pay attention to how you feel. And what may happen is that the illusion of the food may pop when you actually eat it, and then you will be free of that food.

This is about your freedom and your liberty.

Experiments are about:
- Increased consciousness
- Notice how we made the decision.
- Make a commitment to really pay attention to the process.
- Make a commitment that no matter how good it is, we are not having any more of it. So that it doesn't end up on a cascade.

Much of your freedom will come from these types of experiments.
