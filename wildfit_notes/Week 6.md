# WEEK 6
## Day 1
### Welcome to Spring!
Welcome to regular spring!

There might be a lot of emotions, excitement, or fear. Hold on. In the diet industry they give you a restrictive diet similar to where we are now, only this time you are prepared.

We have spent two weeks examining our relationship with food, knowing our psychology, our food triggers. Being more conscious about our food intake. We started adding more of the good stuff, Then we spent 3 weeks making incremental adjustments each week. We have done all of this to prepare us for this moment, the metabolic reset.

Even if you have done the keto diet before, this time is different. This is a huge shift, and a great way of saying goodbye to the diet industry for the rest of your life.

This week become the detective of the process. Remember, this is a break, but this week you might experience the highest degree of restriction. We are getting closer to food freedom.

This is a no complaint zone, request support if necessary.

Progress this week is going to come in two forms:
1. Uncomfortable: When you switch metabolic function your body activate some cleansing. As you cleanse fat, stored toxins also release and you have to cleanse them out as well. there are some cleansing side effects (they are signs of progress!):
	1. Different bathroom experiences, peeing more often or less often, there is a different color or smell. Your poo might be less solid or more solid, or looks more rare. All of this are just adjustments.
	2. Spring rash: A great sign, but only 10% experience it. It's uncomfortable and itchy.
	3. Cold symptoms: Sore throat. Soft flu. "keto flu".
	4. For women: Brings back menstruation if you are older.
2. Comfortable:
	1. Increase and improvement of energy: It can happen suddenly, or slowly.
	2. Skin, hair and nail improvement.
	3. Improved sleep patterns: Sleeping shorter, but deeper and better.
	4. Increased mental clarity.
	5. Increased focus.
	6. Better memory.
	7. Better mood stabilization.

Let's talk about the switch. Because it is safer to store some extra weight, to believe winter is coming.

It takes some arguing with the body to make the switch, and really give you this week to convince your body that this is not spring, that there is an abundance of food:
1. Get out of diet mentality, this is not a week of calorie restriction. Don't get hungry, eat spring food. If you let yourself get hungry, your food devil will stand up and it will make everything harder. And nutritional hunger will get activated. Eat enough. Don't control your portion. 
2. The more stressed you are, the harder it is for you to release the weight, meditate and find calm.
3. Hydrate, get massages
4. Don't bother with the scale. Weighting yourself and not seeing numbers you like gives you cortisol, it raises stress levels in your body so it makes you hold on into fat.

Be excited!
### Live Call
This is the week that the magic starts, any progress in the past few weeks is a bonus.

With muscles, theres two ways to get two failures:
Slowly, and a heavy weight at the start. The second one is better for your bones.

If you cant sleep or wake up at midnight, meditate, write on a journal. Celebrate that you have more time to sleep.

Governments treat water with chlorine and also the water passes through pipes. It's better to drink other water but if you don't have any choice, drink the tap water. The ideal is water from glass bottles.

Uric acid: Meat is not the problem, but metabolic imbalance is.

With low testosterone, don't fight cholesterol


## Day 2
### Live call - Joey
Move your body, something light, walking or Yoga
The lower your stress is, the safer your body will feel to burn fat.

### FAQ
01 - CAN I USE UNSWEETENED COCONUT OR ALMOND MILK IN MY ALKAGIZER?
Not the best idea in the world, be careful and look out for hidden sugars and vegetable oil.

02 - WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE A BREAK FROM BEANS, LEGUMES AND FRUIT AS WE MOVE INTO SPRING?
They have carbohydrates. Fruit is high in them. Nuts, seeds and legumes are a bit different. Beans are convoluted to digest because of the protein and carbohydrates and that's why they cause gas. Don't have a lot of them

03 - WHAT HAPPENS IF I FEEL LOW ENERGY AS I'M GOING INTO SPRING?
For people who have never gotten into ketosis it's a bit hard at first. Move your body, make demands for it. People have different reactions to when their body believes its spring. Look for hidden carbs.

04 - WHAT DO I DO IF MY OLD FOOD CRAVINGS COME SURGING BACK?
This is where you want the correct application of executive function - willpower, to help get you through this. Carbohydrates trigger appetite. You body can get into panic mode. The further and further you get from carbs, the lower and lower the cravings get.

Your gut bacteria develops depending on the way you eat, so if you eat a lot of carbs then your bacteria focus on that. But if you stop, that gut bacteria starts to revolt at first, but the carb focused bacteria start to die off, and the craving for carbs starts to die away.

That is the physical craving, it is up to you to deal with the habitual and emotional craving, and even those will move away as you keep into spring.

05 - DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS FOR EATING OUT WHILE YOU'RE IN SPRING?
It's hard to find spring-friendly food at restaurants. Remember, menus are a badly organized list of ingredients. They put carbohydrates because they trigger appetite.

Assert yourself! Is your body worth it to you? Think about your success tableau. The waiter and the restaurant are there to serve you.

06 - SPRING SEEMS PRETTY LIMITED. HOW CAN I HANDLE BOREDOM?
Right now you are focused on proper traditional nutrition. Let's go back to our ancestors, you could be bored but you had to eat what was given to you. The variety we have been living in is not natural.

Instead of seeking variety on the overall list of ingredients, think of the different ways you can prepare something.

07 - HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE MY BODY TO ADJUST TO SPRING MODE?
It takes relative time to how you've been living, if you have never entered ketosis, it might take you a bit longer, the majority have the switch in this week, some in the second week, and in very rare cases on the third week.

Once you have done it once, it will become easier and easier over time. Your body gets used to it.

To speed up the process, exercise, walk enough to generate some sweat. This indicates your body to release energy.

08 - HOW WILL I KNOW THAT I'VE SWITCHED OVER INTO SPRING MODE?
Some people switch in a flash, others take longer and slower.

Some effects are discomforting, like a keto rash, bathroom responses, varied sleep patterns.
Some nice things are an increase in energy, your energy no longer dips in the afternoon. Craving for sweet things lowering. Your breath and mouth feel different. This is a change in fuel, you generate gasses depending on what you eat.

You can also get keto strips, you pee on them and they indicate if you have ketones in your pee. And, the more efficient your body gets at burning fat, the less ketones show up in your urine.

09 - CAN I WORK OUT WHEN I'M IN SPRING MODE?
Yes, but often for women, intense exercise can generate cortisol and that prioritize the body on sugar burning instead of fat burning, so it might make the opposite.

Generally, start with light movements. Walking. Yoga.

Or higher intensity, zumba classes, dance classes.

For men, you can do gym workouts.

10 - WHAT IF I SLIP UP AND EAT SOME SUGAR, WILL THAT RUIN MY PROGRESS?
In a way, yes, but do the very best you can, this is not a time of experimentation. You have to communicate that fall is over, winter is over, and it's okay now to release weight.

Avoid carbohydrates the best that you can. If you eat something and afterwards you realize, that's fine, fail fast, see the observation, move on and go back to spring, this is better than letting it go back into a cascade.

11 - WILL I LOSE WEIGHT IN SPRING MODE?
This is an ideal season to lose fat. Weight on its own is not an ideal indicator. You may find that you are building muscle and bone density at the same time you release fat.

You may not see immediate changes in the scale, but your body composition is better. It's about body composition. Not weight.

If your weight feels the same, notice how your clothes are fitting, the comments from other people.

12 - WHY DO I FEEL EMOTIONAL OR IRRITABLE?
It's possible to feel this for a short while. in the past, as the carb numbers went down, people started to fight over what was left. This last for 3 to 5 days generally.

Right now, your body is shifting its way in how it deals with energy, so it may have less energy for a bit, and that influences how you feel about things.

13 - WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUNTER, GATHERER, AND REGULAR SPRING?
Hunter: Carnivore, plants fight back, meat doesn't. Doesn't eat any plants.
Gatherer: Vegetarian, have legumes, beans and nuts.
Regular: Regular diet, eats both meat and vegetables.

14 - I'M FEELING REALLY REALLY RESTRICTED. WILL I NEVER BE ABLE TO EAT THOSE FOODS AGAIN?
Wildfit are entirely about food freedom. There are some things you might want to avoid for the rest of your life. You choose how you eat. The end of the program is how you can implement this principles for the rest of your life.

You can bring back foods. Are you going to bring back junk food? it's up to you.

There are 4 core food categories:
1. Essential: Long standing, ancestral seasonally available foods.
2. Functional: Newer foods that might serve us, like new world foods, and changed fruits and vegetables. Like sweet potatoes or avocados.
3. Occasional: They are not functional, only serve for special occasion, holidays. We might need a little willpower to not consume them regularly.
4. Non-food: Foods that you choose you will never have anymore. Food arrives to here not by willpower, but by education and habits

You are empowered to decide what you will eat, what you will not eat ever again, or what you will eat occasionally.
