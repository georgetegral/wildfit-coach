# WEEK 5
## Day 1
### Taking control
Take a moment to reflect on the buffer zone. Did you jump in right away, ease in, or wait until the last moment? Notice how your food devil is adapting—getting weaker but maybe also trickier. If you haven’t already, **revisit the Food Devil Personalities video** to stay ahead of it.

**Sticking with the Holidays**

This week, we’re staying the course. That means continuing our break from:

✅ Sugar  
✅ Grains  
✅ Dairy  
✅ Processed foods  
✅ Alcohol

Optional breaks:
✅ Caffeine
✅ Nicotine

At this point, you might be feeling a sense of restriction. Your life may start to be disrupted by this process

You might have gotten into a restaurant and be "that person", or how your family cooks something for you and you tell them how you want it. Or that your emotions might be up and down because you are not going to your confort foods.

**That’s normal.** But it’s also a sign of just how close you are to a major breakthrough. Keep an eye on the **small victories**—less cravings, more control, stronger decision-making. You are **rewiring your relationship with food.**

You are making progress, you are making a substantial change that will improve your quality of life for the rest of your life.

**Cravings are fading. Control is strengthening.**

Keep going, you have gone so far. Don't surrender to the food industry. When we stop buying it, they stop making it.

Stay the course, keep checking in, and lean on the community for support. You’re doing incredible work—keep going!

Remember why we are taking the holidays:
There's food, and then there are other things. Back in nature we would not see plastic wraps, processed things.

A lot of things they serve you is not food. Junk food should have been called "Non-food".

If we even have those foods to begin with, it should be an occasional thing, and done with consciousness.

Also, a lot of foods you had before had stimulants in it. And when you take a lot of them to make you feel good, you start to lose the ability to make yourself feel good.

In these foods you are taking a break from you there are addictive substances, they are there to remove your choice, to make yourself addicted to it. They don't want you to take a break, to lose their grip on you. Lifestyle disease is a very bad term, it comes from food and tobacco companies shifting the blame from them and their bad products, marketing and manipulation to you.

They did this to us, and what you are doing helps you, your family and society.

### Bonus video: Food Devils
You have a food devil and a food angel, and they both debate, these debates get more intense if you are feeling thirsty or hungry.

Sometimes our food angels are weak at winning the argument, because they were trained weakly by society and our parents. A strategy shown is a strategy blown.

This is why we want to know the strategies of the food industry and the food devils. We want to get to the point that you don't get cravings for non-functional food, you just acknowledge and accept them.

Food Devils:
The bully: "You are going to give in anyway", "you never succeed at this", "you might as well give up now"
The placator: "Oh, but you've been doing so well", "You've been working so hard", "you deserve some kind of reward"
The teenager: "Well, everybody else is having them", "I don't care what that diet says"
The toddler: "I really want cookies", "I feel so bad"
The drug dealer: Wants to get you hooked. "Yeah, you should eat healthy, but let's just have one bite." "just taste it", "just one more"
The people pleaser: "I feel so bad, they made it for us", "they made it with love", "I don't want to hurt their feelings" (they are blaming the other person, if you eat it it's because you want it. It's a deep manipulation. The other person doesn't live in your body)
The sentimentalist: Nostalgia, tradition, "you have to eat this on this particular day", like needing to have turkey, tamales on christmas, new year just because it is expected. This is manipulated by food marketers and our history.
The scientist: Use selected, cherry picked data to convince you of the food you want to eat. (let's not pretend that wine is good for us, it does not reduce the risk of heart disease). The bad data is created by the food industry
The adventurer: "We are on an adventure right now, and on an adventure we can make exceptions" This is common on vacations. "When in Italy, have pizza, have pasta". If you will do this, do it responsibly. Don't let the adventurer take it too far.
The nurse: Almost sounds like the angel. "You've had a though day, and stress, and anxious, tired, sore. I have a prescription for you, a big, fat bowl of ice cream."
The promiser: "We are going to make this exception this one time, but never again." he teams up with the drug dealer.
The procrastinator: "You are right food angel, we have to be good! We should start next week" he kicks the can down the next important date.
The hedonist: Just about pleasure. "Life is for the living", "you only live once". It's fine if you run little experiments here and there later, but the hedonist takes it to the extreme. It prioritizes pleasure over health.
The deal-maker: "We'll eat the cookies now, just one cookie today, and later we will go to the gym and burn it off.", "we can eat two cookies and then we go to the gym two days in a row". THE GYM CAN'T UNDO JUNK FOOD.

You want to spot your internal dialogue, your state of mind and your triggers. Learn about them, understand them and that way you can neutralize them.

If you've ever tried to eat better and not succeeded, there is a dialogue. Take a more conscious approach to your food.

Read through these food devils and learn to identify them.

If a non-functional food gets your attention, say out loud the response you get from the food devils and angel.

We want proper food freedom. When the devils don't even try, and are always aligned with the angel. Understanding this food devils is a major step to give you food freedom.

### Live call
If you feel restricted, look for progress aside from your primary goal. You are letting your body heal. Look out for sabotages in yourself as well as in your family. Be patient, keep doing what you are doing. When others criticise you, it says more about them than about you.

Listen to the dialogue that you are having, listen to the personalities of the food devil. Even if your primary goal was weight loss, we are still not at the phase where we are losing weight. Be aware and look back to all the progress you've made.

You might have some cravings or symptoms but its your body readjusting itself.

You need to get in the kitchen! After the program you need to cook more, look out for recipes and share them with the community.

Regarding alcohol, it has a social component, we naturally want to be included, not having alcohol sometimes makes us feel that we are separating ourselves from the crowd.

If you are choosing to get out of nicotine now, focus on doing your breathing exercises.

Regarding caffeine, what is the emotions and habits behind that? For you day to day living you don't need it.

Regarding thinking about "eating a lot", listen to your body, if you really feel more hungry because of nutritional hunger, eat more. Listen to your hunger to see what it really is, be it real or emotional, empty stomach, thirst, look at the 6 hungers and be mindful.

Always try to get the best, higher quality option regarding food. Wildfit is not about perfection, it's about getting better and take the best decisions you can. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY

This journey is not about perfection, learn to experiment properly, even if you eat something, you have not "fallen off track", you just go back to eating as you normally have.

## Day 2
### FAQ
#### Why do I feel more tired this week?
Many of the things we've taken a break from this week act as stimulants or artificial, cheap energy. And because your body has accustomed to it, the removal gives your body an opportunity to readjust. There can also be an emotional component to it.

Know that this too shall pass, reseting your metabolism is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself.

#### HOW LONG WILL CAFFEINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS LAST?
Fairly quickly, don't take painkillers, ride it out. Drink lots of water, meditate.

#### WHAT SHOULD I DRINK INSTEAD OF COFFEE OR TEA?
Don't drink decaf coffee, the chemicals they use to remove the caffeine are bad for you as well. Also proper tea is caffeinated. You can drink:
- Roibos tea from South Africa
- The best one by far is just water.

Most teas make you pee more, thus you lose water.

#### HOW DO I MANAGE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WITHOUT ALCOHOL?
Alcohol is deceitful. It has social pressure and a low grade social anxiety, so alcohol is a social lubricant for them. Just say you are taking a break from alcohol right now.

Push yourself a little, socially. Be outside your confort zone. Expand your social circle.

#### WHY DO I FEEL MORE EMOTIONAL OR IRRITABLE THIS WEEK?
If there is a substance you have an addiction, there might be withdrawal symptoms and emotional fluctuation. Your inner child can be annoyed as well.

Remember, this process is a jailbreak. Know this will pass. And be mad at the food industry for making you feel like that.

#### WHAT IF I SLIP UP AND HAVE COFFEE, ALCOHOL OR PROCESSED FOOD THIS WEEK?
Ideally, you won't slip up. Wildfit is all about freedom. If you take a sideway, call it an "experiment", the only bad experiment one that either you don't pay attention to, or that you don't run effectively. Slow it down, notice what has been going on in this experiment, how did you really feel, what the consequences were and how you felt afterwards.

You may even find that an experiment is what makes you go towards your freedom. 

But remember: Experiments are not experiments if you run them over and over and over. Then make an absolute commitment to not run that experiment again for the next few days. So that you don't get a cascading effect or even worse, a complete departure from what you are achieving right now.

####  WILL TAKING A BREAK FROM NICOTINE AND CAFFEINE AFFECT MY FOCUS AND PRODUCTIVITY?
It could, they help you get focus until the withdrawal symptom kicks in.

Caffeine helps when you really, actually need it. If you have an important meeting after a long flight, or driving when you are tired. Just take it once.

Any distraction from these exercises will pass.

####  I THOUGHT I'D FEEL BETTER BY NOW. WHY DON'T I?
Is "nothing" better? Any reduction in cravings, better sleep, any improvements? Any progress towards your specific goal?

See how far we've come. All the things you have done. You've made phenomenal progress.

It likely took you decades to create the conditions you want to reverse, remember we are a month into this journey. You can erase many of the damages of decades in these 3 months. Hang in there. Look at the progress you've done.

#### WHY DO I STILL CRAVE SOME OF THE FOODS WE'VE GIVEN UP?
Cravings can be physiological, emotional or psychological. And we are working on all of them.

Are the cravings as strong as they were before? Most likely not.

You are now on the craving escape velocity, things can take more time to go lower up to point zero. Some can take longer.

This program can make near miraculous levels of change. For now, notice how your cravings are starting to come down.

#### HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M MAKING REAL PROGRESS?
It may be you are making progress, but not just about for the main goal you have. If you are fixated on that, for example if your goal was to release weight. It may not look like you are becoming any closer.

In these cases, you want to look to the weeks before and all the progress that you've made on your consciousness.

You are now much further into this program than any regular person on a normal diet. Keep up the good work.

That mountain it feels like it's not getting any closer, then boom, you are on it. Hang in there.

## Day 3
### Taking a break from alcohol
Alcohol is not inherently evil, this is merely about biology. Alcohol simply put, is a form of sugar. And we are working on a metabolic reset in Wildfit, so how your body processes sugar, this includes alcohol.

If the idea of not drinking feels bad, then that is a powerful sign you need a break from it.

Alcohol is a form of sugar with psychoactive effects, it interferes with liver function, spikes blood sugar, it disrupts sleep. **The WHO stated that no amount of alcohol is good for health**, even small amounts increase your risk of cancer, specially breast and colon cancer.

Before, they claimed a glass of red wine was good for your health and your heart, which was not true.

Alcohol is really really new to human bodies. And it's been locked down into our culture and added to our events to create dependency. Culture has made it awkward to say no to champagne during a wedding toast or refuse wine during communion.

We want to be aware and conscious with our relationship with alcohol. If you need it to relax, to socialize and to have fun, you have a dependency.

Initially, alcohol seems like a tool, until it becomes a necessity.

Some people can't have fun without it, because it becomes their social crutch. Remember, alcohol shortens your life.

You don’t have to give up alcohol forever. But you _do_ deserve the clarity and confidence that comes from having a conscious relationship with it. Let’s reset, reconnect — and maybe even reimagine how alcohol fits into your life.

## Day 5
### Foundations Laid. Freedom Ahead
You've laid a foundation before we made our decisions regarding food, and that's what made the escape a little easier. We completed the setup.
The first 2 weeks are the psychological foundations. The next 3 weeks are for taking break from foods that are not ideal.
(even root vegetables might taste sweet to you now!)
The diet industry is focused on taking foods away. We need a conversation on proper nutrition, evolutionary biology and science. Every species on earth has an evolved diet, each one needs certain nutrients and process its nutrients differently. This happens through evolution.
For example, the white Rhino eats grass, because grass is complicated, but the black rhino lives in bushes and trees, and they evolved to eat other plants like the euphorbia tree which is toxic to all other lifeforms, they did this over many, many generations.
You have to get your nutritional needs met and your energy needs met. We were removed from our natural way of life and put in the modern world. We have given our body a chance to cleanse.

What is our natural diet? People and the food industry want you confused with this, but there's no need to be, look at archaeological records, which clearly indicate what we have eaten, we have eaten:
Seasonally available fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, poultry, beans and legumes.

You can also look at modern day hunter-gatherer tribes in Africa, they eat:
Seasonally available fruits and vegetables
Meat, fish, eggs, and poultry

There are also animals very similar to us, chimpanzees and bonobos, we share a lot of DNA with them, and what do they eat?
- Seasonally available fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beets
- Meat, fish, eggs, and poultry

It's the same!

There was never confusion, but it was created by the food industry. We will start talking about metabolism. We will do a Metabolic Reset.

Bears, they hibernate in winter, but to survive that much time without food, the previous season, the fall, they eat a lot of what is available to them, salmon, berries and honey, to prepare themselves for the winter. Now what would happen if we trapped a bear in fall? it would become obese, develop insulin sensitivity problems, and diabetes.

Also us, we have been trapped in the wrong season, this was our "junk food" fall, the seasons that our ancestors lived in were 4:

- Winter: Though, calorie restriction due to drought, very little food around, very though season to survive. A lot of humans died here, and in order to survive it we prepared the season before (fall). We fasted here, for a little while the body burns fat but after a bit it switches to burning protein, this is called autophagy, it's not a bad thing. It burns old, broken proteins and amionacid chains, it burns the old, sick and diseased cells out. This is a great anti-cancer protocol, and nature forced it upon us every year. 
- Fall: Here we ate berries, seasonal fruits, root vegetables and honey. Our blood sugar level spiked, and we had our appetite increased, the more carbs we ate the more cravings we had, so that we fattened up and survive the winter.
- Summer: It isn't so much a separate season, it is like an audition to fall, the early summer berries come out and ease you into eating carbs again, because they can be quite shocking. The same like in fall, your job is to fatten up for the winter.
- Spring: Carbohydrates are not available, here you release the excess kilos you gained in the fall to survive the winter, and here the body moves to fat burning mode, ketosis. When you burn fat, you have a steady flow of energy, with sugar you get ups and downs, and you get "hangry". In ketosis you have steady mental clarity, its a wonderful place to be in.

These are not the seasons where you live, this were the seasons were our ancestors spent the vast majority of evolution, this was Subsaharan Africa. With seasons, the types of food changed

In Spring, rain comes back, the plants start to grow again, and hunting becomes prolific. We turned from a season of lack, to a season of incredible abundance, food was available a plenty.

We will activate the metabolic mode that sparks ketosis in your body. But this is not the Keto diet!

The keto diet is the idea that just because something is really really good, it doesn't mean that it's good all of the time, ketosis is your body's natural response to an absence of carbohydrates, which is something mother nature did to us all the time, and your body reacted appropriately to.

Spring starts next Monday.

What puts your body in this metabolic reset is the absence of all carbohydrates.
Fruit is out of season, root vegetables are no longer to be found.
We are left with:
- Non-carbohydrate vegetables
- Very rare non-carbohydrate fruits like avocados
- Meat, fish, eggs, poultry

There are 3 different ways to going through spring:
- Standard spring: Just taking a a holiday from the last remaining carbohydrates
- Gatherer spring: For vegetarians
- Hunter spring: For inflammation reduction, symptoms you want to get rid off and a deep metabolic reset. This is a fully carnivore diet, only for a short time. Outstanding.

Choose your buffer zone wisely.

Just 10% of people who do the keto diet do it to the point that they get any kind of results, because it is really difficult for them since they go straight from junk fall to ketosis, no foundation, no education, pure willpower.

But this time, you have all the foundations and you will be able to do it.

Metabolic resent causes some symptoms for a small portion of people, could be skin rashes, cold or flu symptoms, headaches, sleep disruption. As you switch up your energy sources you start to need less sleep. Mood swings. If you experience ay of this discomforts, just say "yes!" my body is moving forward. It's going to be amazing!
