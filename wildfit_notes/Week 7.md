### One Week Into Spring—Keep Going
How is it going for you?
How is craving escape velocity going? Are there foods you might not even want anymore?
Are you noticing any differences in energy? Sleep? How food taste?

You may start to release weight, but also have some side effects, sugar withdrawal headaches, bathroom changes, energy fluctuations.

Blame the food industry for this!

This week you are going to feel more free. Craving escape velocity is liberating, health is so liberating.

This week, pay attention to your cravings, and compare them to how they were before. Analyze your food timeline experience, realize how you feel about food. are you more easily satiated?

Pay attention to your hungers.

Even if your stomach is empty, that's a feeling, not a hunger. That indicates that your digestive system is cleansing, healing and repairing. It's a great feeling.

This stage you will neutralize low blood sugar hunger. There's probably less mood swings, more energy, more stabilized mental health.

This week give some thought to the 6 hungers.

For low blood sugar hunger: When you eat carbohydrates, your blood sugar comes up and your body starts to make insulin, and then you blood sugar comes crashing down. That's the sugar crash.

Over the last week you have switched gears into spring mode, so you don't have this crashes anymore, if it hasn't started for you, it will start very soon.

If you feel any specific craving, you know that it's fake, it's just emotional hunger. Acknowledge it, thank it, and to move on from it. Yes, you will eat carbs again but not now, you are in spring. Major breakthroughs are optional.

Move more! If you want to, go into a yoga or tai chi class. A reason to exercise is because your body did not develop a pump of your lymphatic system, only your cardiovascular system.

You want to make sure you don't have any blockages, tumors, or an excess buildup of broken proteins? Make sure your lymphatic system is running really well. Your muscles are the pump, movement was vital for our ancestors to get food and water.

Heart disease is the number one killer now, cancer is number 2, diabetes is number 4. What's wrong is that we have not been putting the right stuff in our bodies, and we are not moving enough.

Even you can stretch yourself every day in your home, and walk up to the point you sweat a bit.

### FAQ
01 - WHY DIDN'T WE CHANGE ANYTHING THIS WEEK?
We have been spending the last weeks to prepare us up to this point. This might be the first week that you get any real benefit of spring.

02 - WHY DO I STILL FEEL TIRED AFTER A WEEK IN SPRING MODE?
You may feel tired if this is your first time ever on in a very long time, it takes time for the metabolic switch to come.  It takes a bit for the body to accept fall is over. If you eat any carbs now you will go back into "winter is coming mode".

This will get better and better every single time.

03 - HOW DO I KNOW WHEN I'M FULLY IN FAT-BURNING MODE, OR IN KETOSIS?
If you start releasing weight, or if you don't, but you are getting smaller. There are also smaller signs, you breath and mouth might feel different. You may have a change in energy, or your energy dips are gone. 

You taste things that before tasted less sweet are now a bit more sweet. 

You can get a blood test, or a keto strip to pee on. If the strip indicates ketones you are in ketosis, no matter the color.

04 - I'M STRUGGLING WITH MY MOTIVATION, I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT MAKING PROGRESS AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STICK WITH IT.
We hear you, this feeling can come up this week. But understand, you are inches from gold, you have done all the hard work, you have laid all the foundation. To get you through this:
1. Powerful executive function. You are making yourself stronger every time you make the right decision.
2. Refocusing: Not focus on the hard things or if you are not dropping weight, start looking for every single example of potential progress. Sleep, energy, cravings, clothes getting bigger, more understanding about food, more aware, more free regarding food?

If you are feeling progress, your motivation goes up, if you can't find them, your motivation goes down and you might need to use a bit of willpower.

This is a tight spot of the tunnel, but we are not far. Hang in there! You are going to make it.

05 - WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR STAYING MOTIVATED?
Look for all the progress you are experiencing, psychological and physical progress.

See your success tableau, that moment so emotional and so inspiring that you want to keep going. Use also the rock bottom perspective. They can put you right back on track.

06 - WHY ARE MY CRAVINGS FOR CARBS COMING BACK EVEN AFTER A WEEK IN SPRING?
Sugar is very prolific that it sneaks into stuff, and that might wake up your sugar monster.

Also it may happen that old habits die hard. The gut bacteria might start to revolt since you are not having sugar. And you sugar monster start to freak out.

Your sugar monster might do a death raddle, it may be that it freaks out and panic the most, trying to get a hold on something that might keep it alive, but the stronger that is, the closer you are to it being over.

07 - HOW DO I HANDLE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING?
That is tough, but, do not make big pronouncements about WildFit and how it will change them, since the minute you do that you give them permission to criticize. You don't need their opinions now.

Be the change you want to see, don't preach.

The only thing you want to communicate is the requests you need to have to facilitate the season you are in. You can even say that you are finding it difficult and ask for their help, and if they see you grab a piece of bread they have permission to remove it from your hands. This will make your friends that want you to give in, your best nutrition accountability partners.

Stand your ground. You are the one that has to live in your body, your consecuences, not them.

08 - WHAT IS THE BIGGEST THING I SHOULD FOCUS ON TO MAKE THIS PHASE EASIER?
1. Look for all progress, mayor and minor, and share it with the community to inspire other people.
2. Focus on getting enough food, don't get hungry, eat to satiation.
3. Focus on your future, your why. Why are you doing this?

Don't let the fade of the pain make the motivation go away. The further away a pain is, the less motivation it gives you. Stay focused on what drove you here.

09 - SHOULD I INCREASE MY EXERCISE INTENSITY?
Increase your cardiovascular exercise if you want to. it's not mandatory. It helps to cleanse your body, the more the better. 

If you are a woman, don't do intensive exercise, as it may cause stress in your body and indicate it to prioritize sugar burning.

Zumba classes, dancing, walking, yoga, pilates, moving with more intention.

10 - ARE THERE HACKS FOR MAKING THIS WEEK EASIER?
- Do not get hungry, have spring friendly snacks close by, and say hydrated
- Magnesium supplements
- Key: Community

11 - HOW DO I HANDLE SLEEP ISSUES?
Your sleep patterns might be affected by spring because of the increased energy.
Check the sleep meditation. Cool your room down, take a cold shower, don't see blue light at night.

When your mind surfaces something, it is reminding you, this is because it is worried you might forget. Keep a notepad beside your bed, write it down and then you can relax.

12 - WHY IS MY CANDIDA FLARING UP?
Candida are little, tiny sugar monsters, gut bacteria that love to eat sugar. If you experiencing symptoms it's because they are dying off, that is a sign it is almost over.

13 - IS CINNAMON OK AT THIS STAGE IN THE PROGRAM?
It is okay, just that we link it to sweet things, it is a flavorant.

14 - CAN I STAY IN SPRING FOR LONGER?
Don't worry about the program right now. And never transition out from spring until you know when you are going back into spring. Your psychology around food will change based on what you are eating.

If you come out and don't plan when to go back in, your psychology will change to start to eat carbs again, and the more you eat, the more of a carb monster you will turn to.
