# WEEK 12
## Day 1
For many many years, this would have been the last week of the program, but there will be 1 more week.

We are back to spring! Did you notice the more sweetness of food?

How did you go back to spring? Which version of spring did you choose?

This week be in spring, and most likely it will be easier, maybe not EASY, but easier.

Is it easier now? Do the cravings come back?

Never ever leave spring without knowing when to go back!

All of these are lessons for your psychology, very important, so that you can stay free for the rest of your life, and have food and metabolic freedom.

Please adhere to spring properly this week, this is not the time for this experiment. The minute you put carbs into your body, the minute you come out of spring. You need to properly feel how spring feels.

This is the last week of Eric guiding the spring for you.

## FAQ
01 - WHY ARE WE RETURNING TO SPRING THIS WEEK?
The reason is because spring is a phenomenal season for healing and health and cleansing. This is a season you want to be comfortable with.

The reason we did it this way this week, is the experience of guiding you in and out of spring.

Carbohydrates serve the function of preparing your body for winter and to fatten up to survive it.

The idea is for you to easily switch back and forth between seasons.

In earlier versions of the program, people struggled to get out of spring after it we over.

02 - HOW STRICT DO I NEED TO BE IN THIS RETURN TO SPRING?
Your sugar monster asked that question! You need to be in spring, no carbohydrates. We are talking about no obvious carbohydrates, you want to develop metabolic flexibility. If you are having carbs every day then the change wont happen with you.

03 - WHAT IF I DONâ€™T FEEL LIKE I NEED ANOTHER SPRING RESET?
Your food devil is asking this question, spring is a requirement of the human body, that's the end of it. Your ancestors never had a choice about this. It was done to them.

Your body has the ability to burn sugar, fat and old, sick and broken proteins. It's not that you enjoy them or they are "nice", is that you have to do them.

This is not about weight loss, this is about metabolic flexibility. Specially if you don't feel like it, this is the week to do spring.

04 - HOW DO I MAINTAIN THIS PROGRESS AFTER THE PROGRAM ENDS?
Remember how life was for you before the program. You may have doubt about the future. This program is designed to permanently change your relationship with food.

You will never experience food the same way before. How do you maintain the program after it ends?

We have rewritten you psychology regarding food, also in week 13 we will recap all the tools and give you some more for your future.

There is also a community, maintain your bonds. If you have a coach, you can get the Wildfit continuity membership, the back to spring program.

And some people do the program again on their own.

You are able to hold on to the progress you have made, and continue to keep making progress.

05 - SHOULD I STAY MOSTLY IN SPRING MODE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?
Humans evolved to cycle through this metabolic modes, we have to run these cicles and not get stuck in any more. Stay as long as you like in spring, carbohydrates are a non essential foods, they help a lot and it is optimal for you to eat them, but they are not necessary.

Staying in spring long term is not recommended, cicle through the seasons.

06 - WHAT DO I DO IF I START SLIPPING BACK INTO OLD HABITS?
Wildfit is about freedom, there is a difference between experimenting and slipping back into old habits.

You will from time to time encounter a food you have not gotten through full escape velocity. What do you do when that happens?

Make a decision to run an experiment, yes or no, and don't allow it become a trigger to "slip back" into old habits. Notice how it makes you feel, and make a commitment to yourself that your experiment is limited to this instance, or this day, or these two days.

This will prevent it becoming a cascading effect.

This is not about living constrained and restricted, it's about your freedom, and freedom means the right to experiment with stuff, but it also means maintaining your freedom from those foods and the disastrous food industry, when they are trying to win you back all the time.

07 - WILL MY CRAVINGS COME BACK WHEN THIS PROGRAM ENDS?
Did you notice your cravings becoming stronger when you reintroduced carbs?
Its more about A) Your commitment to your health, B) Your relationship with carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates are designed to take away your freedom, they are made to make you eat, and to fatten up for the winter. If you reintroduce them without being clear when you will return back to spring, yes, your old cravings will come raging back. You will repopulate your gut bacteria with bacteria that wants carbs. And then, it will be harder for you to go back to spring.

So the best way you know that doesn't happen, is that you never leave spring without knowing when you are coming back.

08 - HOW SHOULD I HANDLE SPECIAL OCCASIONS, REUNIONS, VACATIONS AND CELEBRATIONS IN THE FUTURE?
Many people will tell you "I was doing really well, then X happened", what is that? A holiday, christmas, I lost my job, something bad happened.

First let's talk about the good occasions.
You have to be aware of the deep seated manipulations of the food industry.

You can take it in two ways, the first one is simply not having the non-functional food. The other is running the experiment carefully and with two things in mind:
1. Having the very best quality of the food
2. Do it inside the parenthesis of an experiment. And stick to the end date no matter what.

Willpower is for stopping the pattern. Do this, and two days later the cravings pass.

For the bad occasions:
For some reason, when life gets difficult, we go back to easy calories, carbs and alcohol, this is because the body is stressed and it prioritizes sugar as a fuel source.

What does your body really need when you are in that kind of stress? It needs the very best nutrition. The best season is spring, the best season for those times is hunter spring. And even with some punctuations of winter during those times.

In spring, your moods and emotions are better, during though times, spring is the way to go.

## Day 5
Embracing the power of choice.

We will have another 2 more weeks! Next week you chose what season you want. Fall, Spring. If you are leaving spring, make a strong commitment as to when you are coming back, and share the decision with someone.

Whenever you choose, now you will have a dialogue, now Eric is not choosing for you.

In week 13 we will have short, daily videos.

We have escaped the food industry, and now we are going to talk about getting the knowledge and resources so that they never get us back again.
