# WEEK 2
## Day 1
Food is a constant awareness for us all the time.

The more stressed we are, the harder it is to maintain consciousness regarding our food choices

Last week we talked about reward repatterning, any behavior that you reward is likely to be repeated, so don't reward negative behavior with calorie rich foods.

We also looked into craving escape velocity, the levels are:
Surrender: If you have the opportunity, you eat it
Struggle: Sometimes you can use willpower to resist but eventually you give in
Depravation: You can use willpower to resist it but you are constantly feeling that you are missing out, a feeling of lack
Ambivalence: You are neutral most of the time, but on special occasions you might have it.
Disinterest: You don't even care
Food freedom: I don't even want it anymore, even in social or stressful situations. If you have it, it's based on a conscious decision.
Revulsion: You can't make me eat it.

Food timeline
Paying attention to your whole experience of food, how you felt before eating and all the way into the next day. 

Keep all of these tools into awareness.

You want to focus on getting your needs met, and the natural effect will be that the cravings and non-functional foods start to come down, along with all the health benefits.

This week you are adding good quality, ancestral foods.

There's gonna come a moment when you face a non-functional food and it doesn't taste as good or you become more aware of the long term effects on it. Right now do not stop eating.
"Don't be good" or use willpower to resist foods right now. Or you will be reverting back to diet industry tropes.

### Live call
The food in the US is usually of less quality because of food regulations.

Think about the consequences of the food you will have, and then when you eat the food and experience the consequence then it will feel harder.

Martyrdom: When you want a food and you see other people have it and you feel bad.

After finishing the program, stay connected to the pain you felt before. Don't think that "one will not hurt"

Say fuck you to the bad foods, the damage is perpetual. and if you are going to eat non-functional foods then do it only on peak moments and celebrations, if ever...

Don't say, lost weight, say, released weight.

Don't ask to the doctor "can I get off this medication?", ask him "what needs to happen so that I get off this medication?"

You've heard many people saying they've been doing very well until something happened, a big life event. For you to get through those life events, you want the very best fuel. You need to be putting the very best things in your body.


## Day 2
### Live call
The alkagizer is a great way to get more vegetables in an easy way, but in this part of the program it is not emphazised now so much. Too much kale and spinach is not good.

Regarding the social aspect, a food devil strong in me is the people pleaser, thinking I am inconveniencing, but imagine the inconvenience of being sick, or being very overweight. But  remind that they are approaching it form a place where they want to avoid you having pain. You can also do preframing, which is, before this conversation is had, ask for their support.

Strategy known, strategy blown, know the strategies of the food devils and the society.

Really start to get angry around the food companies that put sugar in everything, notice all of the foods that have gross things in them.

### FAQ
How much alkagizer should I be drinking?
12 oz or 350 ml per day. But there's no real upper end.
You can eat them instead of blending them, it might be better. But it is blended for time reasons. The alkagizer is a shortcut.
If you don't like the taste, you'll grow to like it over time. Also, the recipe can be modified with other things you like.

What do you mean by, “check in with how this food feels”?
How do yo psychologically and physiologically react to your food experience. The idea is to make your food intake conscious. Notice the experience.

What is the food timeline?
The realization of how food makes you feel after you've eaten it. It's about connecting the consequences of your food decisions with the food itself, so that you make a conscious decision about eating them or not. The timeline starts with your emotions, before even eating the food.

Can I use frozen fruit?
Yes, it is not optimal, fresh is better, but it's more convenient. Super cold food can slow your digestive system so see how do you feel with it. Also check the ingredients of your frozen fruit, avoid colorants and sugar.

How can I handle emotional eating?
You can handle it will willpower but it will not work. Better, understand it and we will lay a great foundation with you emotions and food, and the resulting consequences. You will never have to deal with emotional eating ever again because you will have consciousness and you will understand it. For now, be aware of it.

Why am I still eating what I was eating before?
We're here to create lasting change. We don't rely on diet industry tropes.

What if I attempt to remove or reduce some of the foods I used to eat?
Let's celebrate, you are moving through craving escape velocity. Remember, if you use willpower to resist a food, you are using an old diet industry trope, a failure strategy. Better, make sure to eat those foods for now, because when you have an emotional charge before eating the food, it makes the food experience taste better. If something is forbidden, and you give permission to eat it, it tastes much much better, which gives you a distorted view of really how good that food is.

If there is no rebellion, you don't get a big emotional payback and you realize those foods are not so good to begin with. Pay attention to your psychology, physiology and emotions.

Why does willpower fail?
It doesn't, it's supposed to work like it does, a short term solution before giving out. The food angel feels very strong when you make the decision with willpower that you will not have a food. But this is temporal, that is the nature of willpower.

How can I make the alkagizer in the easiest way?
This is not for the average blender, also you can create alkagizer smoothies and put them in an ice tray, and freeze them, and unfreeze them in the morning. this is also great for short term travel.

What should I do if I'm craving unhealthy foods?
Just eat it! At this stage we're only building consciousness. Food freedom is achieved by eating something, not by leaving it out. Don't binge, but play into your normal cravings. Notice the dialogue. Don't use willpower.

What if I dissociate or eat unconsciously?
This is a normal human response. Right now we want to flip the consciousness dial on. It's normal to disassociate every now and then. But the more conscious you are, the faster your journey towards food freedom will be.

What is the best way to eat fruit?
Eat the most naturally occurring fruit you can, avoid genetically modified food. Eat it in the morning, with the stomach empty. In what forms? The more natural the better, chewing is best, blending is okay. Don't juice the fruits, because you are only getting the water and the sugar, and leaving out the fiber and nutrients.

I feel hungrier than before. Should I eat more, or is this part of the transition?
If you are feeling hungrier, maybe if you are eating more carbohydrates they are stimulating your appetite, or you a following an outdated diet industry idea that you should be holding back and maybe you are holding back for this program. Don't be hungry, remind yourself of the 6 hungers, and take action accordingly.

What if I don't have access to high-quality fruit?
Frozen and dried is okay at this stage.

How might alcohol impact my cravings and emotions?
Sugar and inhibition suppression. Alcohol opens your appetite and supresses willpower.

Should I eat fruit on an empty stomach?
Yes.
Our digestive systems are optimized to eat only one thing at the time. This is the best form for our digestive systems. We don't have to do that, but it's something that happens.
It's okay for you to have occasional sugar spikes if it is in season

Difference between craving and hunger, hunger is something that comes within you from a nutritional perspective. Cravings are more emotional. That's why we have the 6 human hungers.

Real hunger, nutritional hunger is when your body is missing something, nutrient, minerals, amino-acids, proteins, fat. Everything else is related to the six hungers.

Thirst, we get so much water from the food that we eat. If you drink water preemptively this is a way to satisfy this hunger.

Low blood sugar hunger. This happens with carbohydrates, bread, pasta, fruit, candy. When you eat sugar, your body produces insulin to break that sugar down. After eating sweet, you might end up with low blood sugar and high insulin, this is an evolutionary trick to make sure you ate enough so that you survive the winter. Notice the food timeline 1 hour after you eat a carbohydrate rich food, notice the spike of energy and the crash.

Empty stomach hunger. Empty stomach and hunger are different things. At the morning notice how it feels.

Ancestral food rhythms: this is the idea that is't not simply what we eat that determines our health, but also when we eat it. This leads to seasonal eating, also the food combinations. Also, when our ancestors woke up in the morning, they didn't have food. They had an ancestral pattern of intermittent fasting.

Consider before having breakfast some exercise or walking, and then when you had your last food of the day consider letting your stomach be empty so it cleanses for the next day. **This is optional.** But this boils down to your habits, if you want to try it. Wake up in the morning, have a glass of water, go for a walk or do some stretches, delay your breakfast a little bit. Then when you have your last meal at night, let yourself go to sleep with an empty stomach.

## Day 3
Even if a product has "organic", USDA, if they are processed, most likely is not good. Syrup, organic cane sugar. Fruit flavored snacks are not healthy at all even if they appear so.

Don't assume the front of the package tells you if it is healthy.

The pressure to eat sometimes comes from the outside, from people who puts their beliefs unto us.

The food devil shapeshifts, using different arguments.

### Video
Right now don't resist food, you want the long term benefits. Much of the forbidden food triggers a biochemical response, which amplifies the pleasure response.

Why is food so hard to resist?

The people of our past:
Since our childhood, certain people gave us foods that created emotional responses that would then drive your decisions in the future. You can link candy to love. Cookie = Love. Ice cream = sitting down.

Look for those linkages so that you may start to break them, once you identify them they lose their power over you. When you have a specific craving, look into your past and identify what's the meaning behind the foods, the holidays, the person.

The linkages are powerful but bringing light into them takes their power away.

The people in our present:
The food devil is inside everyone. People can make you feel shame because "you are on a diet?", "this is a special occasion", "everything in moderation".

Also, the food manufacturers. The slogans are designed as hypnotic statements or chants. They also manipulate with the packaging, making you think that somehow their product is beneficial to you.

One of the core principles of Wildfit is evolutionary biology. Every species evolves a relationship with their food, the ability to eat it, process it and extract nutrients from it. No species is adapted to eating processed foods.

Pay attention to this and rebel, join the food revolution. Some ingredients are designed to manipulate you, to addict you. Even sodas have salt, and a lot of sugar, this in order to make you thirsty so you need another one. Pay attention to where you might be manipulated.

Start reading the ingredients on the label of the products you buy. If you can't pronounce it, it probably is not good for you. Notice how often sugar is in the label.

What if you got angry at the food industry? What if you got angry at the ingredients they put on the food that they are selling? When you get angry, they lose their control over you.

Remember reward repatterining. Only reward your productivity.

## Day 4
Tobacco companies are manipulative and they used those same strategies in the food industry, with lobbying, with misleading labels. They are more interested in profits than in the food or in your health.

Rebel against the food industry. Keep an eye on manipulations, on ads, social media, ingredients, highlight them and share them with the community. One of the things that the food industry does is keep you confused, because if you are confused, you surrender. Increase your awareness for you and the others.

**Today’s Focus:**
- **Spot the Manipulations** – Identify misleading labels, deceptive advertising, and biased media reports.
- **Reframe Rebellion** – Shift your instinct to rebel against food rules into rebelling against food industry control.
- **Track Cravings** – Revisit your craving table and observe if certain foods have lost their appeal.
- **Stay Conscious** – Keep eating mindfully, experiencing how food truly tastes and feels in your body.

## Day 5
If you are going to run an experiment (eat a non-functional food), really enjoy it, have a high quality version, slow down and eat it very consciously, decide the experiment window before the experiment starts.

Do it consciously, if you don't you risk doing it in the diet industry way and risk going back to the old ways because you would be rebelling.

Before you have an experiment, eat the good stuff first.

Only reward the better you, not the tantrum you.

Step 1:
Focus on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods. This means ancestrally relevant foods, foods that humans have always eaten. Seasonally available fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and poultry. If you are a vegetarian add a variety of legumes and beans.

Step 2:
Take a break from certain foods that have begun to lose their control over you.

Step 3:
Recognize that your body has 3 metabolic modes, your body can burn sugar, burn fat, or burn protein. You have to figure out how to burn those through the year. These metabolic modes helped us evolve to survive through the seasons. You want to experience wildfit spring, where you will experience ketosis. Later you want to have summer or fall, ocassionally you may want to experience wildfit winter were you take a fast to prioritize on protein burning or autophagy, where you allow your body to clean itself out its old cells and old proteins.

You should not do this alone.

Keep track of what's going on in your body. Keep track of your progress, and remind yourself of how things were like before.

Hold a very clear vision of your future, your success tableau and your rock bottom perspective.

Something that happens is as you are going through the program and you forget the pain you had before, the food devil comes back again. Keep an eye on what pushed you in and what motivated you to change, and where is it that you want to end up. Very important to do that.
