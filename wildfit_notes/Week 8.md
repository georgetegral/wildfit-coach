# WEEK 8
## Day 1
### The Sweet Spot
At this point, the vast majority of you have made the metabolic transition. Your tastebuds have started to recalibrate, and things that you never considered sweet before taste sweet, that is a very powerful step in your process.

More foods have started to go into the craving escape velocity. Some foods you may start to consider if you ever will eat certain foods again. You are dropping weight, and if not, you weight the same but now you have less fat and more muscle.

Share your progress with other people! Share your victories! You are helping people by doing so.

Many of you are starting to see the light out of the tunnel, others are still in the tunnel but you are sure you don't want to go back. This week there are no enhancements. The vast majority have made the switch.

This week is the stabilization of spring. Increase your cardio movement, get your heart and lungs pumped up, this will improve your metabolism, every day, 15 to 20 minutes at the minimum of moving your body, also move more.

Health categories:
1. Doesn't have any weight to release, no symptomology, good body composition, healthy.
2. Just outside of that, they have that last little bit of weight to release, they have some soft symptoms
3. Someone who is medically obese or dealing with health challenges like diabetes, inflamation and pain.

In this week there is a bonus video only for people who are category one. If there is still weight you want to release then you don't want to put yourself in category one.

But — this is also the week where for some people, the novelty wears off, and the food dialogue might start getting a little louder. Old habits might try to sneak back in. That’s normal.

This is why today is all about remembering why you’re doing this — and tuning back into the incredible progress you’ve already made.

This is the week to stay the course.

You’re not just taking a break from certain foods — you’re reprogramming your relationship with food altogether.

Keep going. Keep noticing. Keep showing up.

You’re doing something extraordinary.

### Category 1 bonus video
Category 1 is por people with optimal health. Category 2 is for people who are not there yet but there is nothing so bad going on. Category 3 is obesity and with a lot of symptoms.

You decide your own category.

If you are in category 1, you might release more weight that you may want, for this you may want to increase your exercise and your fat intake. This will slow down the release. If you still don't want to do this, there is a modification for you.

Spring is not only for weight release, its has other benefits as well.

Changes:
- Increase fat intake
- Increase exercise, strength training.
- Reintroduce root vegetables, not fruits, just a bit of them. (carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes)

You may want to do this now, or in the following weeks. Make this assessment each week and react accordingly.

### Live Call
Higher Uric acid and cholesterol is normal in spring since you are eating differently now, and when you get out of spring that will go down naturally.

You can stay in Spring a minimum of 2 weeks up to 6 weeks maximum.

We need water, and we need it the more natural way possible, Eric is against carbonated or sparkling water, because it has CO2 added to it. But if carbonated water is going to make you drink more water then drink it!

Don’t check your levels so much during the transitional period, but check them after that. Do them a few months after your transformation to see how your levels are compared to before your transformation.

In living Wildfit you can switch between regular spring or hunter spring.

Tomatoes are a new world plant, Eric doesn’t eat them very often. He recommends eating the plants that will give you the least reactions.

Hunter spring and sun light are great for nails and hair strength.

Your cells in your body listen to every word that you say.

For kidneys, avoid aged meat and processed meats. Having organ meats occasionally, not a lot. Still, complete the program and live how you want regarding food for 6-8 weeks and then run tests to see how your levels are.

Most doctors don’t know about nutrition, so you want to change the way you speak to your doctor, and then you will change the treatment that you get.

Most people surrender to social pressure, but they don’t realize that they can influence the pack instead. Standing your ground you can influence and inspire people to make better health decisions.

If your bathroom experience is not so solid then it may be an indicator that you are having a lot of hot fat.

Keep your eye on the future that you want to have, and the future that you want to avoid. That will help you get through this stage of the program. See your wins and keep that as a beacon of hope.

### FAQ
01 - WHY ARE WE STILL IN SPRING WITH NO CHANGES THIS WEEK?
Mother nature used to control food availability and there was nothing that you could do about it. And our body has adapted accordingly, now we are undoing being in a decade or more of being stuck in one particular season.

Later on this week you will understand spring, and enjoy the cleansing. We are now in spring stabilization, the part where your hormones, mood and cravings balance themselves.

If you have released more weight than you wanted, look at the bonus video in day 1.

**02 - HOW DO I KNOW IF I SHOULD STAY IN SPRING FOR LONGER, OR PREPARE TO BREAK OUT OF SPRING?**
You'll know when Eric tells you.

###### 03 - WHAT SHOULD I FOCUS IN WEEK 6 (WEEK 8, IF YOU COMPLETED THE FOOD FREEDOM CHALLENGE) TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT?
Focus on what's working, the benefits that you are experiencing. Pay attention to them. Understand the benefit of what you are experiencing right now. Remember the pain that drove you to get into this program. It's harder to notice the absence of discomfort.

Remember the rock bottom perspective. What do you want to have? How do you want to live your end of life process?

###### 04 - HOW DO I TRACK PROGRESS THIS WEEK?
Observe and notice progress in every part of your life. Remember how stuff was before. Remember the pain, look for the contrast. This will give you the motivation to keep going. Track your progress in your journal. 

Record a voice message or video for you for later in the process. And check it out later in life when the food industry wants to get back to you.

###### 05 - WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CATEGORY 1 VIDEOS?
This are for category 1 people and they have released more weight than they want.

###### 06 - HOW DO I HANDLE FOOD CRAVINGS?
They are almost certainly about emotional hunger. If a food craving comes up, look at the food timeline and check what is the triggering emotion that causes the craving. Connect with other people.

You are reward repaterning. Only reward high quality emotions and only with the best food. Retrain yourself with functional food or with another non-food activity.

###### 07 - WILL MY CRAVINGS EVER COMPLETELY GO AWAY, OR WILL I ALWAYS HAVE TO MANAGE THEM?
Craving escape velocity, you are going through a transition. Yes and no, there might be some foods that you will never want to go back to, and it will not require any major effort. Other foods you may not know yet, and there might be some deep seated food cravings that might show up in the future.

Eric's goal is that you move most of your foods through food escape velocity, and you'll experience food freedom during the program, or some months later.

Some of your freedom will be won experimenting on the other side, not this week.

###### 08 - WHY SHOULD I AVOID EXPERIMENTING OR SLIPPING THIS WEEK?
Because we are in spring, if you eat sugar your body instantly goes back to burning sugar, the minute you eat sugar your body will switch gears and moving it back to burning fat requires a lot more effort, this is not the time to eat carbs.

###### 09 - IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL EMOTIONALLY DETACHED FROM FOOD I USED TO LOVE?
This is exactly the goal. Well done! Expect more of that to come.

###### 10 - WHY IS MY HUNGER SO UNPREDICTABLE? SOME DAYS I BARELY EAT, AND SOME DAYS I FEEL RAVENOUS?
In spring, for our ancestors it was a season of feast and famine. It's normal for you to have days that you don't eat a lot and days where you do.

###### 11 - HOW DO I HANDLE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WHERE I FEEL TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY EAT?
We are wired to want to follow the group in order to not be separated and die. But now this won't happen, so stand your ground and be the change that you want to see in the world, stay the course.

Don't preach, don't lecture, just be yourself and attract their curiosity. You can influence people like that. 

###### 12 - ARE SUPERFOODS NECESSARY?
The word superfood is just marketing garbage. The real "super" food is meat, it is nutrient dense and doesn't defend itself, because the animal already did that. "Superfoods" don't exist.

###### 13 - WHY DO I FEEL SO MUCH ENERGY ON SOME DAYS, AND LOW ENERGY ON OTHERS?
You have a normalization, steadying of your energy. And it will be difficult to remember how low energy felt before. Perhaps you are having a bit of a low compared to a very great high, not to the lows you experienced before the program.

Maybe if you eat more fatty meals you might get an increase of energy.

###### 14 - WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON’T WANT TO GO BACK TO EATING SOME OF THE FOODS WE’VE ELIMINATED?
We did not eliminate any foods, we are taking a break. But yes! That was the goal.

We believe in a natural human diet, with seasonal changes. You can make a conscious decision to go back to summer and eat some carbs. But you NEVER get out of spring if you have not decided when you will be going back.

If you don't need or want to bring non-functional foods. Don't bring them back.

But don't worry to eat again carbs when you get out of spring. Remember seasonal independence and always know when you will go back to spring.

###### 15 - WHAT IS MY BIGGEST SIGN THAT MY BODY HAS ADAPTED TO FAT BURNING?
Weight melting off you, increased energy, increase general sense of mental and physical well being, increased sex drive, increase immunity. And the lack of cravings.

## Day 5
### The Magic of Metabolic Flexibility
You have been around 3 weeks on Spring but congratulations, but there might have been some boredom. But remember mother nature, it didn't care if you still wanted berries or if you didn't want to eat something, it is not Eric's fault that the food industry is making food available all the time.

If you feel stagnated and bored, create some variety in your life. Go rock climbing, walk in nature, do some salsa or bachata dancing, do something different, you don't need to get all of your variety from food. You have to satisfy this needs in other ways.

If you feel stuck, go with your coach, go with the community.

We are going to do another week of spring. There is also an optional movement enhancement.

Muscle density is one of the most powerful influences on you living longer and better. 

Every single day you tell your muscles one of 3 things:
1. I don't care about you. And they get smaller
2. I love you, I care about you. And they stay around the same.
3. You need to be getter. You do this by using them up to and past their capacity with strength training.

The strength training is optional, but very helpful. It's good for your muscles and your bones.

There is two things that make your bones ask for more calcium, the first one is impact, when you run, climb or bang into the floor. The second one is torque, like when you are lifting weights, your muscles are feeling the pressure but your bones as well.
