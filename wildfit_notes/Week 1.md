# WEEK 1
## Day 1
Increase your hydration, one of the 6 hungers is thirst, drink 6 to 8 glasses of water, depending on your needs. Drink water to prevent dehydration.

Do the 5x5 breathing:
5 seconds inhale
5 seconds hold at the top
5 seconds exhale
5 seconds hold at the bottom

5 times

Do this at the beginning and at the end of the day, and when you are feeling stressed.

Take the measurements before the course starts!

Practice conscious movement, how many steps do you take every day? Try to move more every day, walk more, but for now, just measure how much you move every day.

When you do the things that you know that should do and you don't do the things that you know you should not do. The stronger your self-esteem gets and the easier it becomes for you.

If you binged on certain things before starting the course that means you have emotional attachments to certain foods, and with this when you take it away, the craving goes up and the attachment goes up.

If you started eating more healthy before the course started, that means you have willpower, but how long will this willpower last? This typically lasts for 7 or 8 days.

What are you most afraid that Wildfit will take from you?

You don't have to give up nothing at all. This week eat the same as you have before!

To make the program as effective for you:
- Watch the videos as they come out.
- Trust the process

This week, follow your natural inclinations and cravings.

The success tableau:
Moment in time in the future, that has such an emotional pull that will make you push through every challenge. A moment in your future that really charges you up emotionally. Imagine the transformation in the future. You can draw from this when the challenge gets difficult.

Rock bottom perspective:
What pushes you, a moment in your future that's shocking, something that's painful, something that will happen if you don't follow through with the program. Like looking at a doctor's office and seeing something bad there, and wishing you had taken action earlier. Rock bottom is one of the most powerful places of transformation. It's a very scary face.

People in rock bottom they change or they die. You can project your consciousness in the future and see ahead and know that you don't want that.

DO THE BONUS ON WEEK 0.

If you want to be amazing in everything, the first step is to be healthy

Record a message.

Dear me, this is why I'm here, this is the discomfort, the change I want to make, I find it painful, and I'm concerned about the future. So I made the decision to change.

The word Diet means "a way of life". Our job is not to go on a temporary change for a special event, our job is to be back on our diet.

Language matters, you don't lose weight, you RELEASE it. You don't need this weight anymore.

Calories in, calories out is BS.

## Day 2
Diets don't work, they are based on restriction and on willpower.

"I want to enjoy life", but if you want something that damages you, if you could feel the adverse effects that some foods have on you, you would not want to have those foods.

You have foods that fulfill certain emotions.

Progress drives motivation. Celebration is key for the creation of habits.

The ingredient for lasting change is emotional engagement, emotional intensity.

Celebration makes you repeat the activity you did leading up to it. Measure progress incrementally.

### Craving escape velocity
The process of escaping from cravings

The Zero Point: Where a food no longer calls to you at all. To the point you don't want it anymore.

### The 6 hungers
The driving forces of your eating decisions. No one of them causes bad eating, but all of them in conjunction

1. Nutritional hunger: Running low on nutrients.
2. Thirst: Needing water, taken from food or liquids.
3. Variety: Required so that you get all your nutrients.
4. Low blood sugar hunger: Your blood sugar plummets and you need to raise it.
5. Empty stomach hunger: It doesn't actually mean you are hungry, just that your stomach is empty. It's a healthy part of the cleansing process.
6. Emotional hunger: Eating because of an emotional need. Celebration, depression, loneliness.

**Check the workbook to help you identify which hunger do you have.**
### Food marketing
Tactics

Why?
Sugar stimulates your appetite.

You can't say no, only one is not enough.

Pay attention to how the food makes you feel. What it tastes like and the emotions that you feel.
Start to look at the ingredients of the food you eat. Look for manipulation:
- Sugar
- Artificial colors or flavors

## Day 3
Food angel: The one that wants to think long term for your health.
Food devils: The one that wants immediate rewards and unhealthy foods.

The idea is getting the food angel and the food devil on the same page.

The objective is to get to a point where there even isn't a debate between the food angel and the food devil.

There are people who can't have easter without chocolates.

Be very aware of the rules you've made about food.

Food devils also use emotional triggers. Food can be used as pain killers, or can be connected to love.

This week drink high-quality water. Otherwise, eat normally.

## Day 4
Emotional hunger: The more manipulative

Before you take a food, first you think about the decision to eat that food, before the decision, you deal with the emotional state that you are in

### Food timeline
Emotional state -> Decision -> Acquiring the food -> Consuming the food -> The smell -> The first bite -> The second bite -> Continuation -> Feeling after eating it -> Feeling 30 minutes later -> Feeling before going to bed -> Feeling the next morning

In order to pay attention to this, you need to amplify your consciousness.

Humans are good with identifying short term consequences, long term not so much.

The idea is to increase your consciousness about the consequences.

When you eat junk food, when do you start to feel better? You don't feel better when you eat it, you feel better with the realization. It's the internal permission and rebellion that makes you feel better, the brain secretes feel good chemicals, and then they get linked with the eating of the ice cream. and the ice cream tastes even better because of the feel good chemicals, and it reinforces the idea that the ice cream was the cure. It wasn't.

How do you feel after consuming the ice cream, the sugar? 30 minutes later, at night, in the morning?

What emotional state were you in when deciding to consume a food, how do you feel once you made the decision to have a food, how do you feel when you buy it, then right before you eat it, then the first bite, then the second, third bite, finishing it? Then how did you feel when you were done? 30 minutes later, that night, the next morning?

Pay attention to your food timeline.

https://challenge.getwildfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Food-Timeline-Worksheet_v1_compressed.pdf

We want to connect the consciousness of the long term consequences to the eating now.

Stick to your current eating habits.

## Day 5
You have never failed a diet, because the instructions were wrong. And each time that you failed your self-esteem took a hit.

Boredom is a form of safety. Boredom is a sign from your body that you are safe to eat.

Don't reward bad behavior. When life gets hard you need the best nutrition, the best hydration.

Bad emotions are there for you to become a better human being

### Recognizing patterns
Reward re-patterning: Your brain produces feel good chemicals that reward you for doing things that are "good for you". Emotional responses are both a reward and a memory trigger.

In the past, this was very helpful but now we are rewarded for doing disastrous things. Our reward system has been hijacked.

If you do something that gives your body all this serotonin and this dopamine, your body asks "how do I do this again", so, any emotion or behavior that you want to stay, reward it, so it is more likely to be repeated.

If when things get though, you have a bad day, you reward yourself with calories, with sugar, the body remembers, and thinks that in order to keep that, you have to find sadness, frustration and depression.

If you use food to distract you from emotional pain, your body will remember that in order to get that calorie payoff it needs to trigger that pain, and then you'll be trapped in a cycle. Instead, bring consciousness to the table.

DO NOT REWARD YOUR BAD EMOTIONAL STATES WITH HIGH CALORIE FOODS.

Or you will teach your nervous system to make you feel that way in order to get the food.

If you ever going to have a calorie dense food, have it when you are celebrating something amazing, not when you are feeling down.

### The buffer zone
Period of time between the changes, the announcement is given on Friday, and it has to be implemented by Monday, the buffer zone is when you decide when you will implement the enhancements.

### Week 2 enhancements
Avoid:
Nothing.

You want to start to have more of the good things for your body. Your health is far more influenced by getting more of the good stuff rather than eliminating the bad things. Your body has an immense capacity for healing.

Enhancements:
They are optional through the weekend but officially implemented on Monday.

Increase significantly fruit intake. The best way to eat fruit is on an empty stomach. Fruit is a transportation mechanism for seeds. The plant wants to be eaten. If you have a sweet tooth, this will be very helpful for you.

Increase your vegetable intake. In terms of quantity, quality and variety. Experience with organic, and with vegetables you have never taken before.

Incorporate the alkagizer mild. The smoothie recipe, but take note, chewing is always better than blending. No one vegetable should be eaten every single day of the year. The base recipe is a template, you can change the vegetables there. The objective is to get vegetables.

Focus on high quality proteins. meat, fish, eggs, poultry. Focus on quality. You are what you eat, and what your eat eats.
