# WEEK 4
## Day 1
### Call
Seed oils are highly inflammatory, imagine what they are doing to your body.

People want them to join in their misery.

Natural flavors in our products, we don't know what they have, even if it has less than 2% of something.

When we ate carbs it meant that winter was coming.

Your tastebuds change eventually.

Pay attention to why you really want something.

Understanding your buffer zone experience

In the normal diet world, they give you the rules and when you stop following them you lose self-esteem. 

First we focused on seeing how we felt with food. Now, we are taking breaks, but probably it becomes easier the longer as you go.

Consider this principle for the rest of your life:
"A menu in a restaurant is just a list of badly organized ingredients."
You can get creative. BE THAT PERSON, people who are "that person" are the ones who take care of their bodies. That person is less prone to develop diabetes, cancer, heart disease, inflammation.

Species evolve with certain diets from their environment, a specimen of that species that eats their diet will be healthier than one that doesn't.

Every early human had carbohydrates, but which ones? They didn't have dairy. These things had new.

The carbs our ancestors did eat where seasonally available fruits, some vegetables and some nuts, beets and seeds, and honey. They didn't have bread, pasta or potatoes.

Stick with foods that your DNA and your gut bacteria has evolved to process.

Carbs cause blood sugar issues if eaten constantly. Not always when your blood sugar spikes is bad, but when it happens constantly. Or the continual elevation of your blood sugar spike. The spike of your blood sugar is a perfectly natural response from eating carbs. Our ancestors have not daily, constant access to carbs. You are removing junk carbs.

Milk is good for you when you are a baby and when it's for your species. You do not want the milk from other species. Why we drink cow milk, but not rat milk, kangaroo milk.

Regarding seed oils. they cause inflammation and auto-immune conditions.

All of these 3 foods cause inflammation and auto-immune conditions, they are disastrous when consumed too often, too regularly and too much.

Willpower is not a muscle to cause permanent change. It is a strength you use for temporary adjustments. This week as cravings comes up, build executive function. Every single time that you use it, it gets stronger.

External resistance, when they know about it they will give you their opinion. You can ignore them for now. When they see you resisting stuff that they can't resist, it makes them feel small and that's why they want to make you do it. You will make them feel comfortable if you make the bad decision together with them. This is the time to put your walls up to external and internal pressures.

Getting through this week will be life changing for you.

**This Week’s Enhancements:**

We are **continuing our holiday from refined sugar** and adding new food breaks:

**✅ Processed carbohydrates** – Bread, pasta, rice, refined flours, and potatoes.  
**✅ Dairy products** – Milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream (butter is still in).  
**✅ Refined vegetable & seed oils** – Sunflower, safflower, soybean, and other industrial oils.
## Day 2
Regarding substitutes, don't substitute natural sweeteners for artificial sweeteners. You can use other substitutes like cauliflower rice or edamame pasta. But the more processed it is, be more careful and read the labels as companies add the substitute

But be careful to not get into the habit of just substituting things for less tasty and more expensive variants. This will make your transformation more difficult, the idea is to be creative with the food and the recipes that you eat.

### Dairy Delusion
WildFit is about freedom, you never HAVE to do something, we just give you the information so that you make you own informed decision

Eric as he started to have milk he developed a variety of symptoms, and when he stopped having it his sinuses cleared and he stopped having acne.

Is milk imperative to your health?
No, dairy products are a new introductions to our diet, our ancestors never had dairy products. They are far from ideal. Our organism has not adapted to having dairy.
Higher intake of milk is associated with higher chances of bone fracture and a higher mortality rate. The highest dairy consumption countries in the world also have the highest levels of osteoporosis and hip fracture. In Asia and Africa where dairy is not consumed as much, they have much much lower levels of osteoporosis.
Cancer risks go up with dairy consumption, men are much more at risk to develop prostate cancer with higher dairy consumption. In women, consumption of capsaicin increases the hormone IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) that is linked to triggering breast and ovarian cancer.

Calcium regulation system: Milk raises your levels of acidity in your blood, which causes calcium to be taken out of your bones to alkalize it. The histamines in your body go to great lengths to defend your body when you drink milk. Milk drains calcium from your body.

We've been hypnotized to accept cow milk, but not other specie's milk. Also, mammals produce different kinds of milk week by week. So when you are drinking a cow's milk, from what week was that milk? Milk is a perfect food for a baby of that species for that specific week, no one else.

Those hormones have an impact on you. They have instructions for your system, and we wonder why children develop earlier menstrual cycles, earlier development of breasts.

Also, in order to get a cow to make milk, they have to make it pregnant, then, when the calf is born, they take it away and get the milk. The calfs are tortured and slaughtered. And also, hormones are injected to the cow to make its organism think it still has to secrete milk, that cow has become a slave to the milk industry. Also, those cows develop mastitis, and the bacteria that causes mastitis has developed resistance to antibiotics. So you are drinking that infection and pus.

The first issue with drinking milk is lactose intolerance. It causes pain in the stomach, diarrhoea. When your body reacts badly to milk, it is a warning that it is not for you, and even if you are lactose tolerant, it does not mean it is good for you, it has long term effects like sinuses infection, acne, digestive problems.

No dairy means you may stop being allergic to certain things you were before.

"ELIMINATING DAIRY PRODUCTS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATORY MARKERS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE"

What if it's raw milk?
No, we don't have a evolutionary relationship with milk.

A1 vs A2 milk is the same thing, even if you don't have immediate symptoms it does not mean is good for you

MILK IS THE PERFECT FOOD FOR THE SPECIES THAT PRODUCES IT.

Why we believe it's so good? Because the dairy industry has manipulated us since childhood in order to believe that. DAIRY LOBBYISTS HAVE INFLUENCED GOVERNMENT DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR DECADES.

Dairy is NOT imperative for your health. Dairy is NOT good for your bones. Dairy is bad for your health. Milk and dairy is best avoided.

Usually, the first time a person drinks milk, they vomit it, and that's why they gave us milk when we were young so we don't remember the vomiting.

## Day 3

### No Gain from Grain
Bread is basically empty calories with no nutritional value of any kind.

Grains have played a big part of our development with the invention of agriculture, before that we were hunter-gatherers. This was a great way to not starve, and this allowed the development of society.

This change meant that you did not have to walk so much to get your calories, which means you are not walking enough. "If you are not using it, you are going to lose it."

When agriculture happened, the storage of food happened, enabling us to store calories to survive environmental conditions and not starve, this does not mean well-nourished, but this meant you survived.

Population starts to increase and sickness becomes more acceptable, at the expense of the individual.

Sore throats have a function, once your body starts to fight a patogen, the last thing your body needs is for you to be putting stuff in, so it inflames your tonsils (anginas). It does not want to spend time digesting, and you enter a nature induced fast for your body to heal properly. You should get lots of fluid there.

So wheat and seeds, and their enzyme blockers make digestion very difficult, their gluten causes pain in us, and the hormone triggers causes a lot of digestive issues. We can extract empty calories from them, but there is no nutritional value.

They cause celiac disease, digestive problems, intestinal pain. When you eat bread, you slow down your digestion and it makes you want to eat more because there is no nutrients there, that's your nutritional hunger talking.

Grain is though on our digestive systems, and the thing with flour is that when mixed with liquids, turns into "cement", and it's very difficult to get out of things. Imagine how it gets stuck in your intestines, and how it causes stiffness, irritation, and removes some of the nutrient absorbing layers of your intestines.

Your body needs time to cleanse if you eat them. Grains are not part of the human diet.

## Day 4

### FAQ
#### Can we use butter or ghee?
Yes, we don't use dairy, but as fats go, we have a limited choice to the fats that we can use for cooking, the worst are vegetable oils and seed oils. Coconut oil, avocado oil and olive oil, are great. Most of the things that are harmful of dairy products have been cooked out or processed out of butter and ghee. Ghee is cleared butter where the lactose has been cooked out.

#### What can I use instead of milk?
You don't need milk, so you don't need a substitute with milk, but if you want to, not any of them are particularly good for you, just not as harmful.

Almond milk, but be careful of seed oils and added sugars. Also, the brown shell of almonds contain lectins, which can be hard on the digestive system and not ideal.

Soy milk: Very high in estrogen
Oat milk: Very high in carbohydrates
Coconut milk Has sugar in it

Each one has its own challenges, but none as bad as dairy milk. Why do you need an alternative at all?

#### How will this affect my baby?
Milk is species specific and developmental specific. Look for solutions if you can't breast feed your baby.

#### Can I use bone broth soup?
Yes, this is a very welcome addition, Eric loves it as a snack and for breaking out of fast. It's incredibly satiating, 1 cup can give you a powerful sense of fullness. 

Experiment with it!!
#### Is sugar free gum ok?
Any time that something says "sugar free", and it tastes like sugar, it is full of other things that are not ideal for you.

Don't add it.
#### My over-the-counter drugs have sugar in them. Should I keep taking them or find an alternative?
Many medications have sugar in them! If you require it, find an alternative that doesn't have sugar in it.

Over the next few weeks you may find that the symptoms that made you go to that medication begin to diminish, and maybe you will stop needing it.

#### How should I handle the removal of dairy products and grains?
We are just taking a vacation for now, don't eat them. Recognize that they involve our comfort foods, our emotional eating.

You may feel some emotional emptiness, but remember it is temporary, and a very powerful step towards food freedom. And this foods are designed to take your freedom away. In the future you may choose to have them consciously.

The harder you think this may be, the more you need to do it. the more challenging you find it, the more necessary it was for your physiology and psychology.

#### Are there extra resources about dairy products and grains?
There are bonus videos and a PDF.
#### What should I do about not emotional eating?
Many of our comfort foods are in the grain and dairy category. You may need to use a tiny bit of willpower and a decision to not eat it now because you are taking a holiday from those foods.

Remember: Those foods never address those emotional needs in the first place, just distract you from them. And even made the problem worse. This foods never address your emotional needs and never will.

Look at the food timeline and see which emotions trigger which cravings, and ask yourself "what else can I do to address this emotional need, that does not involve food?"

Call a friend, go out, spend some time with your children, take out your pet. Do the real things that your emotions are asking you to.

Remember that there is a community with recipe ideas that are wildfit friendly. Alternative flours.

You did not develop certain nutrition habits by yourself, they were taught to you, put in the marketing and lobbying, and your social community.
#### You're asking us to take a break from milk, but I heard A2 milk was good?
A2 milk still has lactose. It's for baby cows, not for you. Some influencers just want to drink milk. And just because it doesn't hurt you doesn't mean it's okay or that it will not hurt you in the long term.

Milk has lactose, lactose is sugar, you can't break down lactose unless you have lactates, which most humans don't have. But this does not mean it's good for them.

## Day 5

### Strengthening your food freedom
The average people sticks to diets for around 7 days, you are now 4 times that in the WildFit program!

This week you might have felt a bit of restriction. How are you feeling?

At this stage of the program, your neurology is starting to change, and you've probably bumped into temptations and suggestions from other people to get out of the holiday that you are on. Every single time that you refused, it becomes easier for the future.

Have you felt any withdrawal symptoms? Any cleansing?

Have you noticed that some people have been resistant to the changes you have been doing? Don't make big announcements or try to convince them that you are doing WildFit and that they should too. Friends are far less likely to try to derail an experiment than a diet. But you are not on a diet. But if you make big announcements to people, they even try to look to see if you slip in and fail. Be the change you want to see in the world.

Enhancements:
Continue the break from:
- Dairy
- Processed grains
- Seed and vegetable oils
- Refined sugar

Start a break from:
- Processed foods (packaged or processed)
- Alcohol

There is nothing redeeming from alcohol, it does nothing good from you.

Having one small drink every day is worse than having a Saturday drinking night, as that gives your body more days to recover from the damage. You might not be comfortable in certain social situations without alcohol.

There are 2 types of alcoholics:
- The one who destroy their lives, hit rock bottom and bounce back up.
- Who manages it quite well, but destroying their lives but not fast enough to hit rock bottom, just a long and slow decline.

Revisit your relationship with alcohol.

Then, there are two voluntary and optional holidays:
- Caffeine
- Nicotine

What it's relaxing about having a cigar is the breathing, which you can mimic with the 5x5 breathing.

You can use caffeine occasionally. If you before have tried to eliminate caffeine and gotten withdrawal symptoms, it's an indication that you may need to reevaluate your relationship with it, and now's the perfect time to do it.

You should be angry with companies that put addictive substances in their products, that is designed to cause you pain when you don't consume it.

Withdrawal symptoms are amplified by dehydration and malnutrition. Top up your hydration and nutrition.

### No bread… but what instead?
For many people, taking a break from bread can be a challenging step. We have bread for breakfast, bread for lunch, so what are you supposed to eat instead?

Of course, there are countless options, but it might take a little creativity at first. The internet is full of recipes, and there’s no shortage of cookbooks either. To get you started, here are a few great breakfast ideas:
