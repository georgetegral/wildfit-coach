# WEEK 9
## Day 1
### Spring Forward: Rebuilding Trust with Your Body
This Friday there is an optional enhancement.

Our cohort is now divided between 3 groups of people.
- Hell yes! I am going to be in spring forever.
- I can still do this but I am curious when it will end.
- When this will end? This is awful.

Spring is a cleansing and regenerating season. As people move further and further from the pain that drove them to this program, their motivation starts to fade away. This week in particular think about where you started and where you are now. The pain, the hunger, the symptomps.

The cravings are vastly inferior from where they started 2 months ago. Contrast were you where before and where you are now. Compare beliefs, psychology, cravings before and now. Be careful and maintain a consciousness of what pain drove you to do this program.

Be conscious of that success tableau, those moments in the future where you are healthy, full of energy. Also keep your rock bottom perspective for when the food devil comes knocking on your door, the possible conversation with the doctor. The aim is not only to get through this week, but do it life long.

Remember that the food industry is not on your side, and that they are tracking you, there's the food delivery trap, the "putting candy at the checkout register" trap. Those traps can have one or two effects on you.
1. Significantly create caving and desire on you. This happens by being sad that you can't eat them, having the feeling that you are restricted will impact on your willpower.
2. Getting mad, thinking "I don't want that", look at the kind of people that shop in the fast food places, are those your people? Look at the manipulation that the food industry is doing. Respond with irritation and anger.

You are almost free, you are free. They will keep coming for you. Even after when you escape out of the tunnel the dogs and guards will keep coming to get you with advertisements, social media, disinformation, cognitive dissonance, lobbying. They will try everything to get you back.

Later we will focus on how to keep free from that and keep your freedom.

Continue to stay in spring. Don't stay only focused on one single outcome, look at all your progress.

If you are not releasing any weight now, you can talk to a coach. Our you can have fat bombs, the recipe is in the platform. This is a fat heavy snack that will jolt your system. This will mean to your body that there is abundance. Another thing is that maybe you have been eating too much fat, a lot of fatty meats, in that case, go leaner and try to bring down the fat quantity.

This week the optional enhancement is strength training to help you release energy from your body. This makes big energy demands on your body and makes it comfortable releasing that energy. This is about muscle and bone density. 

## Day 2
### Live call
Emotions want to be felt. Just feel an emotion, don't want to solve it, just learn from it. Know how does it feel and where does it feel.

If you feel weak you could probably lack minerals.

Add some more salt and trace mineral, take magnesium supplement.

Spring makes you lose more minerals as usual.

Add a little bit of lemon in your water.

If you are tired you can try drinking more water or going for a walk.

You can get bone broth without sugar or potatoes.
### FAQ
01 - WHY ARE WE STILL IN SPRING WITH NO CHANGES THIS WEEK?
This is called metabolic reset. be careful for the food industry setting you traps. On friday there is a change.

02 - HOW DO I KNOW HOW LONG I SHOULD STAY IN SPRING FOR?
Depending on your health category, and what your optimization strategies look like. You may want to go into spring when you have a big exam or something big going on in your life. We will look at this in week 13

03 - WHAT CAN I DO TO GET OVER A WEIGHT RELEASE PLATEAU?
Usually this plateau are in a round number. If this happens to you then relax, this has to do with your beliefs around that number.

Stop blaming yourself, let it go. Don't weight yourself. Also you may be experiencing body recomposition.

Look at your belt hook, your clothes or your face.

Look for hidden sugars, eat enough, don't be in scarcity diet mentality.

The biggest thing is to relax

04 - WHY DO I STILL EXPERIENCE OCCASIONAL CRAVINGS EVEN THOUGH I’VE BEEN IN SPRING FOR SO LONG?
Cravings are not always nutritional, remember the 6 hungers. One culprit is everlasting temptation, the food industry is always putting traps, and it can be hard to live in a world like this.

The more you feel that you are missing out, the more likely that your food devil will want to get it. Get mad when you see the traps, get mad. It will help you understand.

Look at our emotions, you have been breaking those patterns, but they might still take more time to reset. If they resurface again, look at it as a craving echo, laugh at it, and move on.

05 - HOW DO PEOPLE HANDLE SOCIAL SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DON’T WANT TO EAT OFF PLAN, BUT THEY FEEL PRESSURE TO?
Stick with it, be the change you want to see in your friends and family.

If they offer you something functional but out of season, say thank you and that you will take it in a few weeks.

Communicate effectively with people. "I am not doing that right now". I don't do that. And the best, the last one is to ask for help to those same people.

06 - HOW DO I STAY MOTIVATED IF THE PROGRESS FEELS SLOW?
You probably are there to a certain degree, but ask for help from your coach. If there is literally zero progress, write to Eric.

07 - WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR STAYING ON TRACK THIS WEEK?
Pay attention to your progress, find ways to create variety for spring. Build a community.

08 - IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TOWARD FOOD I USED TO LOVE?
Yes, that is part of the goal. You might also have indifference towards certain functional foods. That will go away when you change into a different season.

09 - HOW DO I HANDLE EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES WHEN IN SPRING?
We often turn to substances and food to distract us from what is happening in the now. Move your body.

Life has tough days, and the most common reason why people can't stick with their diets is a bad day. But this will put in the wrong substances for the wrong psychology and make thing worse.

The best season for emotional turmoil is spring and winter. Because of better flow of energy and more stable emotional experiences.

10 - WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I NEED LESS FOOD THAN BEFORE? IS MY METABOLISM SLOWING DOWN?
Carbs stimulate appetite, if you don't eat them, those cravings start to go down, And you are also eating very nutrient dense foods that your body is satiated and you have been hydrating.

11 - WHAT HAPPENS IF I WANT TO STAY IN SPRING MODE INDEFINITELY?
Not a good idea. The best option is to cycle in and around seasons.

12 - HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN MY BODY IS READY FOR ME TO INTRODUCE NEW FOODS?
You will learn in a later week how to do seasonal selection depending on your goals

13 - WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MINDSET SHIFT I SHOULD FOCUS ON THIS WEEK TO ENSURE LONG-TERM SUCCESS?
Stick with it this week

## Day 5
### Ready for the deep clean
What is a metabolic mode?

This is when your body is in a particular fuel burning mode. We can burn sugar, fat, or protein. We can't burn all at the same time, we burn them relative to the season we are in. Every species has adapted to its environment. You even hear people talking about OMAD, one meal a day, but that is not going to work for us, that is not how our metabolism evolved. These are the seasons our metabolism evolved to:

- Winter: Very difficult, drought, famine. Our bodies needed to prepare for that, the best way was to have stored water and stored energy in our body
- Autumn: The season before winter, with calorie abundance, there's berries, and fruits, root vegetables, honey, it's carb season, it's incredible. If they did the right things in the carb season, they would survive the winter. (eat as much as they could find). The minute they started eating carbs they would experience cravings that made them go out and find more food. They developed low grade insulin sensitivity so they didn't burn all the sugar and store it as fat. Some of them would have developed some mood swings

You might think that winter was the season to release all the fat, but no, in calorie restriction your body goes into stress mode and won't want to release fat, because it doesn't know how much this restriction will last, so it becomes very conservative about releasing any fat, it will start burn protein, it first starts with old, sick proteins first, collagens, old skin cells, old cells in general.

It's an incredible cleansing opportunity. And then the rain would come crashing down, the green would start to show up, and then the animals starts to have their babies and the hunting becomes amazing and suddenly there's incredible abundance, and the body realizes that it doesn't have to burn its internal structures anymore, plus, I don't need to carry all this fat anymore! In fact, I want to let it go because without it I am an even better hunter.

It's not that we evolved these metabolism reactions to survive these seasons, but in each season the body does important work.

- Spring is a fantastic season for regenerating and cleansing, with abundance. You go into fat burning mode.
- Summer: We move into carb season, you will start to burn sugar, your psychology will start to change a bit, your gut bacteria will change a little bit, you will start to become a lot hungrier and a full time eater, constantly in the search of food.

What would happen if we never did winter?

I imagine 1 of 3 people would die of cancer, prolific levels of auto-immune disease and inflammation, this is not the only factor, but it is a major one.

This is where willpower comes in. Nature used to do it for us, now we have to use our own education and consciousness to make us move through these seasons.

With this in mind, this is an optional enhancement:
Do a winter fast.

In a winter fast you will not eat any food. You'll have water and potentially bone broth soup if you are not ready for a full water fast.

Eric's invitation is that you do at least 1 day just to see how you feel. And if you feel well, potentially you do 2 days. The goal would be to do 3 days.

Why? When your body goes through the first 2 days of fasting, it will realize it is in winter and will switch to that protein burning mode, and it will start burning old, deceased, broken protein chains.

This is one of the most powerful anti cancer protocols you can adopt, Eric does this almost once a month.

It is pretty daunting. if this is too much for you, stick with spring for now, hang in there.

If at this stage you have had enough transformation, no problem. We'll talk about this next week.

Make it minimum 1 day. The next goal might me 2 days, and the final goal is 3 full days.
