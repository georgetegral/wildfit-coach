# WEEK 3
## Day 1
Sugar is designed to stimulate your appetite, it's designed to make you hungry. Remember, this is a break from sugar, to understand all the changes your body will have.

Read the ingredients label in the items you buy, so that you look out for sugar. Almost all processed foods have sugar, and it is in things you might not expect at all. Become the sugar Sherlock Holmes and find it whenever you can.

If you find something that you wanted to buy but you realize it has sugar, don't be sad, that will trigger depravation, be angry, be annoyed. Because they want you to get addicted, they want to drive profits. If you stop buying it, they will stop making it that way.

Increase your intake of fresh fruits and dry fruits if you have sugar cravings.

Understand the psychology of sugar. When you encounter sugar, your body thinks that this is a rare thing that you need to eat as much as possible. This manipulates your brain. It creates a strong dopamine reaction, its objective is to make you remember when you got that sugar from so that you survive the winter.

Be aware of how the processed foods that you ate go down the craving escape velocity. Every day gets better and better and better, but you have to watch out for the food devil that wants you to "reward" yourself for being "so good". Pay attention to your feelings, your thoughts.

Right now, we will have 2 core videos, Mondays and Fridays.

There are also bonus videos, there is also the community. The stronger your sense of community is, the stronger the transformation.

Congratulations! This is going to be transformative for you! Freedom has to be fought for. Whenever you feel the restriction of the journey, and you start to think that before you had more freedom, that is an illusion. The food industry gives you the wrong food, that restriction was imposed by them, you should have been free all along.

Be inspired by other's people successes. If you are feeling down or restricted, have proactive communication, look for help, ask for inspiration.

**Today’s Focus:**
- **Start Noticing Hidden Sugars** – Check ingredient labels and identify where sugar is sneaking into your food.
- **Reframe Your Mindset** – This is an **experiment**, not deprivation. Observe how your body and mind react.
- **Choose Whole, Nutrient-Dense Foods** – If you crave something sweet, reach for naturally sweet foods like fruit.
- **Engage with the Community** – Share your discoveries, questions, and insights to stay motivated.

### Call
When we go hungry that's when we don't make the correct calls regarding food. One of the cores of Wildfit is to not go hungry, because when we do we make decisions that don't support our ultimate goals.

### FAQ
01 - ARE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS OK THIS WEEK?
If you were using them, you can keep using them, but don't use them to replace your regular sweetener.

02 - CAN I DRINK PROTEIN SHAKES?
If you were already having them, keep having them except if they have refined sugar in them, investigate the ingredient list. If you didn't have them before, don't introduce them this week.

03 - CAN I EAT RICE, POTATOES, PASTA AND BREAD THIS WEEK?
Yes, you may find your craving for carbs go up, don't increase your intake of those, but maintain the habits that you had before

04 - HOW WILL MY BODY REACT TO TAKING A BREAK FROM SUGAR THIS WEEK?
Some people don't have symptoms but others do, look for support in the community, increase the intake of fresh fruits and dried fruits. If you really can't resist, have fruit instead of other carbs

05 - CAN I USE HONEY OR NATURAL SWEETENERS THIS WEEK?
You can continue to use them as you used them before, don't increase them or use them as a substitute for sugar.

06 - WHY DO SOME OF THE FOODS I EAT HAVE SUGAR IN THEM, WHEN I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD?
Sugar labeling is very tricky, you can observe the sugar content in the ingredient list and the nutritional table. This week you are avoiding the added sugars, not the nutritional content of the food.

07 - WHY ARE MY SUGAR CRAVINGS SUDDENLY SO INTENSE?
It's psychological, look for the 6 hungers, also the taking a break can give you a craving fluctuation, if this happens increase the intake of fresh and dried fruit, it's best to have them on an empty stomach.

Naturally, when there was fruit available in nature it meant that winter was coming, so your appetite was stimulated so that you gained weight for the winter where there might not be food available.

Look out for emotional hunger. Look for another way to address the state in another non-food way.

08 - I'M GETTING HEADACHES. IS THAT FROM GIVING UP SUGAR?
You are taking a break from sugar, not giving it up. It is possible you have withdrawal symptoms, but unlikely. Have enough water, minerals and fruit.

09 - WHY DO I FEEL EMOTIONAL OR ON EDGE THIS WEEK?
We will have both physical addictions and emotional addictions. Some of those are born of the habit of addressing particular emotions with sugar. You might start having a feeling of restriction, but know it is temporary, you might have them again in a conscious manner. Have some water and listen to the meditation.

10 - HOW STRICT DO I NEED TO BE ABOUT REMOVING SUGAR?
Be diligent, militant. This will only work effectively if you don't let in sugar. Sugar is hidden in our food. Often bread, bacon, tomato sauce have sugar. Run this experiment properly.

11 - WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I ACCIDENTALLY EAT SUGAR?
Do the very best that you can, avoid it whenever possible. If you find out, stop in the moment. Your tastebuds will adapt to less sugar. If it happens after the fact, analyze your response, don't beat yourself. Do this the best that you can.

12 - WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN IS RESISTING THIS PHASE?
This is the part of your brain that has resisted changing your relationship with food or going on a diet. This might cause your body to feel a bit uncomfortable. You have to know that in nature, sugar was something rare, now it is overabundant. Use a little bit of willpower to resist it in this phase if you have to.

13 - HOW CAN I FEEL MOTIVATED WHEN I FEEL DISCOURAGED?
Some of the discomfort is an echo from the past. Remember this is a break from refined sugar, not that you are going to never eat sugar again. Look into your success tableau and your negative motivation. Find the community and the coach.

14 - HOW DO I DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESSURING ME TO EAT THE THINGS I'M
AVOIDING RIGHT NOW?
Your friends actually want to help you, saving you from a Diet, but they are repeating their own patterns and they will feel more comfortable if you repeat them as well. If you demonstrate positive steps towards a better life, you remind them of their poor decisions, and threaten their self esteem.

Don't say "I really shouldn't have that..." say "Oh, I am not eating that right now", with confidence. You can speak to them in advance and say that you are running an experiment and taking a break from all refined sugars, and that you are asking them, as your friends, for support, to avoid refined sugars.

When people make something "out of love" for you, it only works when it's something that you actually want. Not something that you hate. It's not that they want you to fail, it's just that they have also been manipulated by the food industry.

## Day 5
The reason they put sugar in everywhere is because they want you to eat more.
If you are feeling restriction, know that this is temporary and food freedom awaits at the end.

This week's enhancements:
- Continue away from refined sugar
- Take a break from processed carbohydrates and grains
- Take a break from dairy products (except butter)
- Take a break from vegetable and seed oils

Continue drinking the alkagizer and fruits.
This might feel a little restrictive, you might feel a little discomfort. Grains are unnecessary.

When giving up dairy products, people thought Eric was crazy.
The fact is that milk is good for you when you are a baby and you are drinking milk made by your species. It is specie's specifics and time specifics.

According to the developmental cycle of the baby, the mother's milk formula changes according to what the baby needs. It's different in week 1 to week 9 to week 24.

If you are a human, you want your milk from a human and from the right week of development that you are. Once you are an adult you don't need it anymore.

Watch the bonus video on dairy delusion.
Most of the milk generated in the developed world is generated by cow farms where they are treated absolutely terrible, and have fed into them hormones.They develop antibiotic mastitis which is very painful and can't be treated, they are milking them anyway.

In the U.S. the milk industry asked the FDA to raise the acceptable levels of white blood cells in milk. (AKA infection). That milk is bothering you.

This next step might feel like a challenge, **but remember, it’s just a break**. The goal is **observation, not deprivation.**

This is a very exciting phase of the challenge. It can be though but the payoff is absolutely fantastic.

Observe your behavior and your response.

There is a lot of confusion out there regarding food, and that confusion is intentional because the more confused you are the more you surrender to the food industry. Don't go out there looking for alternative opinions. Take the break, run the experiment and see the change for yourself.

Eric has vast experience regarding food. Trust in the process. Stick with the program.
