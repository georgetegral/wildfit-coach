## Success tableau
Think about some time in the future, what do you want your life to be in the future, but phrased in the present tense. Print it.

## Rock bottom
You don't have to get there, you can push your consciousness out there and imagine the scariest version of the future of the particular series of decisions you are making. Revisit it if you feel like you are going off course.

Create visual representations of both of them. Through the success tableau and the rock bottom perspective you can find inspiration that will help you take decisions regarding your diet. It's okay for your goals to be modified through the program.
