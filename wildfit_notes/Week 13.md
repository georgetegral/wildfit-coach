# WEEK 13
## Redefining Normal

Progress is fundamental to your motivation.

The more you teach something, the more you want to live up to it. The more you live up to wildfit, teach it, even become a coach, the principles of WildFit lock in.

Pay attention to your food dialogue, the devils. They will start to try to tempt you again. This psychology is a huge part of your freedom.

Remember the 6 hungers.

Thirst: Drinking water before eating

Nutritional hunger: Eating enough high quality foods.

Low blood sugar: (spring eliminates this)

Emotional hunger: Using food as a drug, to make you feel better.

Variety: We can experiment, learn different ways to cook, create variety within the context of healthy food, or new experiences.

Empty stomach: You can be incredibly well nourished and your stomach can be empty.

Made the decision to maintain a conscious relationship with these hungers.

### Two principles:
Celebration is the locking-in of behavior. What is your celebration of finishing wildfit. focus on what went well.

Something motivated you to be here, pain, discomfort, maybe they are gone or greatly reduced, you should celebrate that! Remember that the further away the pain is, the less motivating it is. Even the pain can become part of the motivation.

## Mastering Food Freedom
Seasons - Ancestral food rythms
The core principle is this:
ANIMALS OR ORGANISMS EVOLVE ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY LIVE

If we flow with the seasons, we will have optimal health, if we get stuck in one season, we will start to develop issues. Which seasons? We are talking about the seasons from Sub-Saharan Africa, where our ancestors developed.

Summer: Plant life is everywhere, tons of food, berries, early honey
Autumn: Lot more carbs available, honey, root vegetables, easy to find food
Winter: Cold, dry, drought, food is scarce, the #1 cause of death is starvation, here the body burns protein, old skin cells, "cleaning house", it looks to burn the broken stuff
Spring: Rain comes, all the wild animals give birth at the same times, this creates an incredible hunting season.

What is each season for?
Summer: The reintroduction of carbohydrates to start preparing for winter
Autumn: A season of accumulation (fat, water), and slowing your metabolism, to retain energy and survive the winter.
Winter: A season of lack, repair and cleansing. What might happen if someone does not do this cleansing, would they be clogged up? Develop cancer? By Eric's opinion, this is the single most effective cancer prevention protocol.
Spring: A season of rebuilding and abundance, greens and meat in abundance, rebuild muscle mass, bone density.

There are really only 3:
Winter: Cleansing season
Spring: Recovery and rebuilding season
Summer/Fall: Accumulation, preparation

We have 3 modes for those metabolic seasons.
Winter: Burning protein, removing old cell
Spring: Burning fat (ketosis)
Summer/fall: Burn sugar

If you skip one of these seasons, you might have consequences, and you skip the benefit of this mode, which will manifest later in life. It's very very difficult to skip fall.

You want to create ancestral food rhythms:
1. Seasons, choosing seasons consciously.
2. Fasting, delaying your first meal is an ancestral rhythm, wake up in the morning, go to the gym, have a walk, and then have breakfast. Equally, at night, don't eat at night, as a hunter gatherer you did not eat at night.
3. Pace of eating, chew enough, and not hurt your body's own satiation signals. Slow down your consumption of food, chew properly, and chew your fruits and vegetables

How many days would you like to stay in spring, summer or winter.

Eric's ratio is:
3 weeks of spring
3 -4 days of autumn
3 day winter fast

This is optimized for him, building muscle.

If you have certain symptomology, then you want spring to be the bigger part of your ratio, if you want to do cleansing, then you want to add winter. Mostly you don't have to force yourself to be in fall.

When you leave spring, you must know when to go back.

Important:
What seasonal ratios do you want to operate with?
How do you want to start and finish your days?
The pace at which you eat. With any foods that produce hunger, you really hae to be mindful of eating slowly and chewing. Fruit, nuts, and of course, junk food.

## Strengthening your resilience
Parenthetical food experiences

Experiences that are inside parenthesis, a dysfunctional food habit becomes the norm and the functional food situation takes place sparingly, we are going to switch it. The parenthesis is the occasional treats you will give yourself.

When you treat yourself, treat yourself well. Uplevel the quality of your parenthetical experiences. Have responsible food, not full of chemicals and refined sugar. Not pretending that that is an elixir of health, but it's not so bad for you.

Food Experiments: With foods that are not totally out of the food escape velocity, it's okay, a food experiment is a temporal food experience, designed to allow you to experiment the given enjoyment and consequences to a certain food. When you make an experiment, define a end date to close the experiment. Conduct short experiments

During travel, you can expand the parenthesis, but no more than 7 days, never more than 7 days, if it runs for more than 7 days, you run into the risk of your gut bacteria changing, your psychology, your identity, and then you are back to the start.

Eat the best quality food, and create a temporary time period, and the key is that you do it with intense consciousness. If you are not observing, it's not an experiment. You may notice you feel okay, or feel bad after, be very conscious of how you feel.

Principles:
- Uplevel the quality
- Food Experiments
- Do it with intense consciousness
- It's better not to conduct lots of experiments, specially when you are in a health recovery journey.
- Don't eat junk food when you are suffering.

When you are recovering, and you experiment, it's kind of a setback.

Don't do parenthetical food experiences when you are suffering, grieving, with anxiety, stress, because you need your best mind, and body for these experiences. Any behavior that you reward, gets repeated.

## Identity over willpower
Food dialogue, angel and devil dialogue. A strategy known is a strategy blown.

If there is a particular food devil you struggle with, you can print a face of it on the house, on the kitchen, to make it more conscious.

Food timeline, unconscious eating is a survival mechanism. This is the application of consciousness to the whole food eating process. When you are eating conscious food then this does not matter too much. But if you run an experiment, you'll notice the consequences.

Also, if you feel a problem, don't try to solve it with food, because they distract you, instead feel the emotion and analyze what is happening. Do things that actually solves the problem.

Reward-repatterining, any behavior or emotional state that your reward is very likely to be repeated. NEVER reward negative emotions with high calorie food. Use them for rewards for unbelivable functional behavior. "reward" your very best behaviors, you will lock in those behaviors, and then you won't feel the need to go for the food.

Emotional eating leads always to disaster, instead change your state with things other than food, and you never reward bad behaviors, only great results and behaviors, with high quality foods.

## Are you still free?
This challenge is over, but it is the beginning of a new way of life. 

Course correction. Life is going to interfere. If you find yourself sliding back to not wanting to go back to spring, or winter.

There's a technique, "The countdown technique", you realize that you have slid a little, with a season or dysfunctional food. When this happens, the minute you realize you have gone off course, the number pops on your head (less than 10), that's your body telling you how long you have to fix it. This means, X days from now on, we are getting back into spring, no matter if we do it alone or with a coach or with other people. And the time between today and X is the buffer zone. And when the buffer zone ends, you start spring, and you lift the food quality. Be it spring, or re-enroll in wildfit.

Agree to follow this, and your subconscious mind will tell you a number, it will.

There is freedom on the other side of a promise. Your only value in the world is your integrity, you can lose everything but if you are a man of your word, you'll rebuild everything.

From now on, treat promise differently, promise will mean "no matter what, this is how it's going to be done, period, it's solid, it's done". So the day you make the decision that your promises mean something, you will not break your promise to yourself or others. Don't make promises you can't keep.

Start with small promises, and every time you keep your promises your self esteem build. When you do what you say you will do, your self-esteem grows. Promises you make to yourself, never break them.

Be very mindful with your promises, only make promises you are fully committed to keeping.

What if you said "I promise I will be in spring for two weeks". When you are first building this way of seeing at promises, don't make promises too big, because you will break them and lower your self-esteem, or keep them and be so frightened about making promises in the future.

Upgrade your promise, to yourself, to other people. Start small, and then use it to control going in and out of seasons, to make food experiments.

The food industry will never give up, so make yourself clear to you on why you are here and why you want to live a better life.

Your two futures:
1. The future the food industry wants for you: Eat their products. Remember the rock bottom tableau.
2. The great health you can get: If you are emotionally connected to your highest vision, you will be drawn towards it.

Remember the vision you have for your health, your mobility, the doctors' appointments, your end of life process.

When other people tempt you into their way of living and eating again, know that by not doing it, you are actually helping them. Your health will be around the average of the 6 people you spend the most time with.

Create a network of health-oriented people.

You can even get into the living wildfit membership. Give thanks to your coach.

## FAQ
### WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS, AM I ON MY OWN?
There is a problem of confidence created by the diet industry, the good news is that you didn't go on a diet. You are not on your own, because this is not over. There is a larger WildFit community. Go somewhere far with people, go together as a team. Even you can become the leader in your own community, be the change you want to see in your community.

You can even get a coach if you need so, and retake the program, and the back to spring program.

### WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON’T GET ALL THE RESULTS I WAS LOOKING FOR?
Everybody comes to this program with a different set of goals. Generally speaking, people have spent a decade in the wrong direction, and we have just spent 3 months together. Now you have had some incredible benefit.

Consider that the problems you have had may need more time, as you stay on track you will keep continuing on your goals.

Also, focus on what went well, you will be more motivated, and keep on track. Focus on the things you have done well, and be proud of that! On what you have improved

###  HOW DO I KEEP GOING WITHOUT THE DAILY VIDEOS?
 You can keep on by listening to your own internal dialogue and seeing how you react to the daily "temptations" every time you reject the negative voices, they become quieter, every time you empower the positive voices, you make them louder.
You still have the content, and there is a wildfit membership program.

### WHEN SHOULD I GO INTO SPRING NEXT?
You decide! We never leave spring unless we know when we will go back into spring again. So decide when you will get into your next spring or winter fast.

### NOW THAT THE PROGRAM’S DONE, CAN I EAT ANYTHING I WANT?
Strictly speaking, you can. The program is all about freedom. But, do you really want to eat back the way you eat? Are there any foods you will never had?

Pay attention to the process about food experimentation. Be conscious about the choices you make, the experiments and the food you eat. Some of the best food freedom you will get is when you conduct an experiment.

### WHAT IF I FALL OFF THE WAGON OR SLIP UP AFTER A FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS?
Wildfit does not have a wagon, there is no wagon to fall off. But there is a chance you forget the principles, that's why we do this refresher in week 13, and why we create your food constitution.

Usually people are kicked off from the wagon by the food industry. And we will show you how to let it happen in a controlled manner, and then course correct. The more often you will course correct, the better off will be.

Know you will need to make course corrections, and the faster you make them, the better.

### HOW DO I MAINTAIN MY MOTIVATION NOW THAT THE STRUCTURE IS ENDING?
You are responsible to maintain your motivation, what is it that you want and not want? Success tableau and rock bottom perspective, if you maintain focus on these both perspectives you will maintain motivation. Also, progress, you have to know what your progress has been, positive steps. Remember that something drove you to spend time here. If you are not in pain, it easier to listen to the food devil.

### WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN THE SOCIAL PRESSURE COMES BACK?
- **Social Pressure is Real:** Be prepared for friends and family (the "food industry's agents") to tempt you back into old eating habits with loving gestures, special occasions, and justifications (like holidays).
- **Find Your Balance:** Don't aim for rigid perfection, but prioritize your health. Remember the risks of poor health: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, inflammation, and chronic medication.
- **Define Your Rules:** Clearly define your food constitution, rules, flexibility, experimentation, and course correction strategies.
- **Social Responsibility:** Recognize the broader impact of your health choices. A healthier population is more resilient to pandemics, reduces strain on healthcare systems, and discourages the food industry from producing unhealthy foods.
- **Lead by Example:** Focus on changing yourself first. Your friends' attempts to sway you might stem from their own insecurities about their health choices. Your strength can make them feel weak, so be the change you want to see in them.
- **Occasional Treats are Okay:** It's fine to indulge occasionally, but consider the context. If you're with healthy people, it's less of an issue. If you're with people struggling with their health, holding the line can be a positive influence.
## WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I SHOULD CARRY FORWARD FROM THIS PROGRAM?
The most important takeaway from the program is that **your health span is your responsibility.** No one will care about your health as much as you do. Health span (living as long as you enjoyably can in the best possible state) is more important than longevity (merely living a long time, potentially reliant on medical interventions).

### WHAT IF I STILL HAVE SOME LINGERING CRAVINGS?
- T**wo Types of Cravings:** Recognize the difference between natural cravings (triggered by natural hungers) and manipulated cravings (driven by the food industry). You've already addressed many of the manipulated cravings during the program.
- **Triggers:** Be aware of potential triggers that can reactivate cravings:
    - **Deep Emotional Experiences:** Job problems, loss of life, relationship breakups. During these times, prioritize nourishing and hydrating yourself well instead of turning to junk food.
    - **Familiarity:** Driving through old neighborhoods, attending events, being around old friends, seeing advertisements, or experiencing life events.
    - **Reintroducing Carbs (Coming out of Spring):** Expect increased cravings when you reintroduce carbohydrates. Understand this is a natural, evolutionary response, not a personal failing.
- **Strengthening vs. Weakening Cravings:** Every time you give in to a craving, you strengthen it. Every time you resist a craving, you weaken it.
- **Consciousness is Key:** When cravings arise, especially after reintroducing carbs, recognize them as an old, outdated evolutionary message. Bring your consciousness to bear and understand that times have changed.
- **Use Your Tools:** Pay attention to the tools and resources you learned during the program, such as the food timeline and food dialogue.
- **Remember the Impact:** A craving you respond to will come back stronger. A craving you resist will come back weaker.

### WHAT IF I DON’T WANT TO EVER GO BACK IN SPRING AGAIN, BUT I STILL WANT THE BENEFITS OF A RESET?
- **Freedom of Choice:** You have the freedom to live as you choose.
- **Seasonal Benefits:** Each season plays an important role in your metabolism. Humans weren't meant to live in only one season. Experiencing all seasons is optimal.
- **Springtime PTSD:** If you're hesitant to return to Spring due to past difficulties, understand that it gets easier each time.
- **Metabolic Flexibility:** With each Spring and Winter fast, your body becomes more metabolically flexible.
- **Support is Available:** Consider working with a WildFit coach and doing the "Back to Spring" program for support. It's a shorter, more concise program.
- **Evolutionary Design:** Humans evolved to experience each metabolic mode, and these modes have functions that need to take place for optimal health.
- **Keep an Open Mind:** Revisit Spring from time to time, even if it's not for as long or with support.

###  I’M NERVOUS ABOUT EATING OUT AGAIN. WHAT IF IT UNRAVELS ME?
- **Restaurants as Resellers:** Recognize that most restaurants are resellers for the food industry, focused on making food yummy and convenient while boosting profits.
- **Categorize Restaurants:**
    - **Never Again:** Identify restaurants that you realize aren't selling real food and avoid them.
    - **Navigable:** Restaurants where you can make conscious choices.
    - **Incredible:** Restaurants with well-sourced, well-prepared food. Prioritize these when possible.
- **Menu as Ingredients List:** Remember that a menu is just a poorly organized list of available ingredients. You can often create healthier combinations by ordering items separately (e.g., grilled salmon with broccoli instead of salmon cream linguini).
- **"That Person":** Don't be afraid to be "that person" who modifies their order. The benefits of avoiding heart disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic medications, and living a fulfilling, healthy life outweigh the social awkwardness. Be that person!

### WHAT DO I DO IF MY FAMILY STILL EATS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ME?
- **Acknowledge the Difficulty:** It's difficult to watch family members trapped by the food industry and see the potential consequences. It can feel similar to having a family member with alcoholism.
- **Resist the Urge to Push:** Do not try to push your family to change, as they will resist.
- **Lead by Example:** Be the change you want to see in your family. Show them what's possible.
- **Attract, Don't Persuade:** Attract them to your way of eating rather than trying to persuade them.
- **Permission to Persuade:** When they become curious and ask questions, you have permission to persuade. Persuading without permission creates resistance.
- **Inspiration Can Come From Anywhere:** Share stories of families transformed by healthy eating, even if the initial inspiration comes from an unexpected source (like a child inspiring their parent).

### I STILL FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IS THAT NORMAL?
- **It's Normal:** Feeling like you should have done better is normal, and almost every client experiences it.
- **Desire is Key:** The desire to want to do better is incredibly important. It's why you showed up for the program in the first place.
- **Growth Mindset:** Your desire to do better is why you _will_ do better and continue to improve.
- **Don't Strive for Perfection:** Don't feel like you've arrived and it's all done. That's a path to stagnation.
- **Celebrate, Don't Beat Yourself Up:** If you feel like you could have done better, don't beat yourself up about it. Celebrate it.
- **Take Action:** Ask yourself how you can improve and then take action.

### DO I NEED TO TRACK MY FOOD GOING FORWARD?
- **Not Required:** You don't _need_ to track your food going forward, unless you want to.
- **Pattern Assessment:** Keeping a food journal can help with pattern assessment. It makes it easier to link what you ate to any consequences (like headaches) because our memory is often unreliable.
- **Freedom is Key:** It's not a rigid requirement. Do it if you feel empowered by it.
- **Easy Method: Private Messaging Group:** Create a private group on WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram (invite a friend and then remove them). Take photos of your meals and post them in the group. They'll be timestamped and dated, making it easy to scroll back and see what you've been eating.
- **Authenticity is Important:** Unlike sharing on Instagram, this method is for your personal tracking, so be honest about what you're eating (even the "Double Sunday").

### HOW DO I KEEP FOOD FROM BECOMING AN EMOTIONAL TOOL AGAIN WHEN STRESSFUL TIMES COME UP?
- **Stressful Times Trigger Ancient Instincts:** Recognize that stressful times trigger ancient instincts to consume calories, even though those calories are no longer functional.
- **Cookies Don't Help:** Understand that cookies and other junk food only distract you for a few minutes, then cause blood sugar irregularities, cravings, and amplify the pain.
- **Carbs Can Increase Irritability:** Carbohydrate foods can make people more irritable, grumpy, or hungry due to sugar crashes.
- **Masking, Not Dealing:** Using food to mask emotions is similar to using drugs or alcohol. It's not dealing with the problem.
- **Get Tougher:** When times get tough, get tougher. Go into Spring or do a Winter fast to dial in your body, reduce inflammation and cravings, and improve blood sugar management.
- **Be Ready:** Aim to be steady, ready, and able to handle anything by prioritizing your health during stressful times.

### HOW DO I NAVIGATE CELEBRATIONS, HOLIDAYS AND TRAVEL?
- **Refer to Week 13 Videos:** This topic is well-covered in the Week 13 videos.
- **Parenthetical Food Experiences:** Think of food experiences during celebrations as parenthetical—they can be removed from the sentence (your life) without changing its meaning.
- **Keep It Parenthetical:** Don't let these experiences become a regular part of your life. If you remove the brackets, the next sentence (day) will have the same problem.
- **Experimentation and Course Corrections:** Refer to the Week 13 videos for guidance on experimentation and course corrections.
- **Example: Pizza in Italy:** You might not regularly eat pizza, but you could have it as a parenthetical experience while traveling in Italy.
- **Close the Parentheses:** When you return home, close the parentheses and return to your normal eating habits.
- **Don't Change Your Identity:** Do not let the vacation change your identity. Vacation was parenthetical.

### SHOULD I WEIGH MYSELF NOW THAT THE PROGRAM’S OVER?
- **It Depends:** I don't know, should you?
- **Weight is Not the Best Indicator:** Weight is not a particularly good indicator of your health. Body composition is a bigger issue.
- **Emotional Experience:** What is your emotional experience of standing on a scale?
- **Avoid Stress:** If standing on a scale is stressful for you, don't do it very often.
- **Check-In:** If you weighed yourself at the beginning and middle of the program, you might want to do it now to see where you ended up.
- **Impossible to Judge on Weight Alone:** It is completely impossible to make a judgment on somebody purely on weight.
- **Losing Fat, Gaining Muscle:** You can be losing fat and gaining weight (or not losing weight) due to increased muscle mass, body movement, and protein intake.
- **Weigh Yourself If You Like:** Yes, you can weigh yourself if you like. If you find it stressful, don't do it so often.

### CAN I REALLY DO THIS FOREVER?
- **Not Totally Your Choice:** It's not entirely your choice anymore. The information and strategies you've learned will likely stay with you.
- **To What Degree?** It's not a matter of _whether_ you will continue, but _to what degree_ you will continue.
- **Permanent Changes:** Certain things will likely never go back to the way they were before.
- **Power to Fix It:** You will always know that it's in your power to fix it if you stray off course.
- **Course Corrections:** You will continue to make new course corrections and observe things you didn't notice before.
- **Not a Diet, But a Changed Diet:** You didn't go on a diet; you worked to change your diet.
- **Motivation and Reflection:** Your level of motivation, how closely you pay attention to your success and where you want to end up, and how often you reflect on what you want to avoid will influence your commitment.
- **Surround Yourself Wisely:** The type of people you spend the majority of your time with will heavily influence your commitment.
- **Be the Example:** By being the example you want to see in the world, you will stick with these ideals in a much stronger way.
- **Vote with Your Dollars:** When you buy something, you are voting for that food to be made again. Choose wisely.
- **Food Revolution:** By taking on the role of an official member of the food revolution, it will be easier for you to stay on track.
- **Some Version of This Forever:** You're going to do some version of this forever.
