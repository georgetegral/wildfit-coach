# WEEK 10
## Day 1
Keep track of the victories thus far.

You can take an optional winter fast. Fasting is one of the most important aspects of human life.

You body has the ability to burn 3 different types of fuel. Sugar, fat and protein.

If you put carbohydrates, it will burn that. as long as you are consuming carbohydrates your body will not burn fat. In spring we remove carbohydrates and it burns fat.

If you don't have any food at all, it will burn protein. It will not burn high quality proteins, it will start with broken, low quality, clogging proteins first. The winter fast is a very important cleansing property.

Fasting mistakes:
1. Get into a fruit fast before the actual fasting. This makes you crave sugar more.
2. Long term fasting (7 days is too much!)
3. Don't do any physical activity, putting your body in a sort of physical hibernation. You need to move!
4. Break your fast with coconut water and fresh fruit. Immediately causes huge sugar cravings.

Fasting can be very important for your preventative health protocols.

This friday, we will move out of spring, and then back into spring.

## FAQ
How long should I stay in winter?
Depends with your experience and response, take it one day at a time. After 48 hours is when the magic starts to happen, here your body moves into protein burning.

Break your fast in the mid morning of the fourth day.

You can go on longer, but it is easier when you are in a fasting environment, it is not recommended to do it if you will be making important decisions, driving, operating heavy machinery.

02 - WHAT IF I CAN’T COMPLETE THE FULL 3 DAY FAST?
It is fine, no problem. Don't suffer, it's about metabolic reset.

03 - I CHOSE NOT TO DO THE FAST AND I’M STAYING IN SPRING. IS THAT OK?
Yes! it is optional

04 - WHY DO I FEEL SO EMOTIONAL WHEN FASTING?
When you do this, you are changing things inside your body, and that change might reflect on your body. By the third day this goes away, and if you do this more and more it is easier. Ease your way in and develop comfort with it.

05 - I CHOSE TO STAY IN SPRING. AM I MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING BY NOT DOING THE WINTER FAST?
Not really, spring is wonderful, winter fast has a different purpose. Burning protein is very important for your body, is an anti-cancer protocol. Do it in sometime in the future.

06 - SHOULD I CHANGE HOW I EXERCISE THIS WEEK?
Maybe, in spring, no, if in winter. If this is your first time you will have energy fluctuation, don't go into lazyness mode, don't rest all day. Our ancestors, when there was no food, you went out to find it, also, when you stop moving, your body stops generating energy, seeking energy from your own body.

Maintain some level of movement so you are making energy demands on your body. If you are experienced, you can do everything regularly, if you are just starting, do it lightly.

07 - HOW DO I KNOW THAT MY METABOLISM IS REALLY DOING THE RESET THAT IT’S MEANT TO DO?
Often people notice that their tastebuds change, and a change in energy, cravings, sleep, and moods.

Into fast, initially it can be a little bit of havok.

08 - WHAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME TO BE FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW?
Feelings of restriction, lack of variety, the further away you get from the pain and discomfort, the less it motivates you.
When we are in pain, we are more motivated to act. When you make progress, the food devil might come and say you "deserve" food.

Maintain your perspective, the previous pain, and the progress thus far.

## Day 5
We have been in spring. You took action and have done an incredible job. We will come out of spring. Some people say "thank god", another reaction is "I feel so good."

This is an important principle:

**Never ever leave spring without knowing when you will go back in.**

Know this for the rest of your life.

When you are in a carbohydrate season, you crave more carbohydrates. When you are in spring, you drop those cravings.

When you come out of spring, you will naturally want more carbs, and the more you are out of spring the more cravings you will have. So make a strong commitment as to when you will go back into spring again.

Whenever you are out of spring, you don't want to leave it for very long, the longer you are out, the more you stimulate carb consumption.

You also want a hard stop, when you are going to get out of spring.

Set the dates.

You can also set some triggers, like when your weight comes up, or your body composition changes, then you go into spring again earlier, to be aware of those metrics.

If this is your first time, get out of spring and come back the next week. And the more you come in and out of spring, the easier it gets in the future.

Do this momentarily, notice the food timeline.

What carbohydrates you want to add back?
Not processed ones.

Start with root vegetables, and then to berries, do it gently, they will start to come back more gently. You want to have a nice, moderate relationship with carbs this week. Do not return to junk carbs.
